Figure 1 depicts the SolarChem ontology and its three associated modules: SolarChem
Photocatalysis, SolarChem Electrocatalysis and SolarChem Photoelectrocatalysis.
The three modules import this core ontology to extend it with specific terms about
the type of catalysis experiment regarding input product role, conditions, conversion metrics, etc.

The ontology revolves about the concept `solar:ExperimentExecution`, that refers to
the execution of a catalysis experiment and its characteristics reported from a
scientific article. The articles where the experiments information is extracted
are described with `schema:ScholarlyArticle`, which in turn indicates its authors (`schema:Person`) and
their affiliation (`schema:Organization`). Experiment Executions can be part of
an experiment (`solar:Experiment`), that is likewise reported in an Scholarly Article.
In addition, Experiment Executions can be of type baseline or reference.

Experiments are performed under specific conditions (`solar:Condition`), such as temperature
(`solar:TemperatureCondition`), pressure (`solar:PressureCondition`), pH (`solar:pHCondition`),
reaction time (`solar:ReactionTimeCondition`), type of reactor (`solar:ReactorCondition`)
with its volume (`solar:ReactorVolumeCondition`) and residence time (`solar:ResidenceTimeCondition`),
reaction medium (`solar:ReactionMediumCondition`,
which can be either liquid or gas), operation mode (`solar:OperationModeCondition`,
which can be either batch or continuous), and electrochemical configuration
(`solar:ElectrochemicalConfiguration`).
Additionally, for photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis
experiments, the type of light source (`solar:LightSource`) is also described, as it plays an essential
role in the experiment execution. Light sources may be of a particular type (e.g.
ultraviolet, sun light, etc), be produced by a lamp (`solar:Lamp`), have a certain
wavelength (`solar:Wavelength`), irradiance (`solar:Irradiance`), power (`solar:Power`)
and illuminated area (`solar:IlluminatedArea`).

Experiments use chemical entities as input (`solar:Input`).
Chemical entities are modelled as `skos:Concept`, and as their instances may come
from Wikidata or ChEBI.
The input substances play a certain role (`solar:MaterialTransformationRole`)
in experiments (e.g. catalyst, reagent, co-catalyst), and are displayed with a
specific band gap (`solar:BandGap`) and surface area (`solar:SurfaceArea`) of reaction.

Observations (`sosa:Observation`) are generated by experiment executions.
These observations may be raw from the experiment execution (i.e. what is directly measured, `solar:RawObservation`),
or calculated (`solar:CalculatedObservation`) applying a formula to a Raw Observation.
A subset of Calculated Observations may also be normalized (`solar:NormalizedObservation`).
Observations refer to a Feature of Interest (such as Selectibity Percentage, Production of a chemical substance, etc.),
and a quantification of the observation is described as a result (`sosa:Result`).
