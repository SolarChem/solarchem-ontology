Figure 1 depicts the SolarChem ontology and its three associated modules: SolarChem
Photocatalysis, SolarChem Electrocatalysis and SolarChem Photoelectrocatalysis.
The three modules import this core ontology to extend it with specific terms about
the type of catalysis experiment regarding input product role, conditions, conversion metrics, etc.

The ontology revolves about the concept `sc:ExperimentExecution`, that refers to
the execution of a catalysis experiment and its characteristics reported from a
scientific article. The articles where the experiments information is extracted
are described with `bibo:Article`, which in turn include its authors (`schema:Person`),
their affiliation country (`schema:Country`) and the journal where it is published
(`bibo:Journal`).

Experiments are performed under specific conditions (`sc:Condition`), such as temperature
(`sc:TemperatureCondition`), pressure (`sc:PressureCondition`), pH (`sc:pHCondition`),
reaction time (`sc:ReactionTimeCondition`), reaction medium (`sc:ReactionMediumCondition`,
which can be either liquid or gas), operation mode (`sc:OperationModeCondition`,
which can be either batch or continuous), and electrochemical configuration
(`sc:ElectrochemicalConfiguration`). Additionally, for photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis
experiments, the type of light source (`sc:LightSource`) is also described, as it plays an essential
role in the experiment execution. Light sources may be of a particular type (e.g.
ultraviolet, sun light, etc), be produced by a lamp (`sc:Lamp`), have a certain
wavelength (`sc:Wavelength`), irradiance (`sc:Irradiance`), power (`sc:Power`)
and illuminated area (`sc:IlluminatedArea`).

Experiments use chemical entities (`chebi:24431`) as input (`sc:Input`), and produce others as
output products (`sc:Output`). The input substances play a certain role (`sc:MaterialTransformationRole`)
in experiments (e.g. catalyst, reagent, co-catalyst), and are displayed with a
specific band gap (`sc:BandGap`) and surface area (`sc:SurfaceArea`) of reaction.
The output substances produced are measured with their quantity, and described
further with conversion metrics (`sc:ConversionMetric`) and electrochemical metrics
(`sc:ElectrochemicalMetric`).
