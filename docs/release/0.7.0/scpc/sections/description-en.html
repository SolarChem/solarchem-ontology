<span class="markdown">
This module extends the SolarChem ontology with several concepts. First, it adds
a subclass of `sc:ExperimentExecution` to denote photocatalysis experiments,
`scpc:PhotocatalysisExperiment`. Then, it adds several types of the roles
that an input chemical substance can play in the experiment (e.g. dye, reductant,
support), and some additional conversion metrics (e.g. quantum yield, photonic efficiency).
Moreover, it adds one more condition that plays a role in the experiment
execution, the reactor condition (`scpc:ReactorCondition`), with provides with
different types of reactors (e.g. slurry, membrane, optical fiber).
