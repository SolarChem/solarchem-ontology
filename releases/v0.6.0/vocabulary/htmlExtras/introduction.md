Vocabulary for the representation of photocatalysis processes mentioned in scientific papers. These experiments serve to define how a photocatalysis experiment has been done; under what circumstances, what products were used and what have been the results in order to analyze and reproduce the experiments mentioned in the articles. This vocabulary has been created in collaboration with the [IMDEA Energ√≠a](https://www.energia.imdea.org/) institute of Madrid.

This vocabulary is based on data used by the [IMDEA Energy](https://www.energia.imdea.org/) institute as part of its **[Artleafs](http://www.artleafs.eu /)** project. This project is dedicated to storing information regarding scientific articles related to the field of artificial photosynthesis, which is used to report how the photocatalysis experiments are done, to facilitate access to information and reproducibility of the same. The vocabulary also reuses concepts from other ontologies such as *[the Bibliographic Ontology](https://bibliontology.com/)* (BIBO) and [schema.org](https://schema.org/) to represent articles that define the experiments and their authors; *[Chemical Entities of Biological Interest](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/)* (ChEBI) used to represent chemical elements and *[Quantities, Units, Dimensions, and Types](https://www .qudt.org/)* (QUDT) for quantities and units of measure.
