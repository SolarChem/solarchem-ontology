In order to download all the PDF files to do the mapping, please execute the python file found in: *{your_proyect_dir}/data_mappeator/pdf_extraction*

It generates a ***articles_pdf*** folder in *{your_proyect_dir}/data_mappeator/resources* and all the PDF files from the articles found in *{your_proyect_dir}/data_mappeator/data/paper_refences.csv* will be placed here.

Finally, it will generate a new ***map_file.csv*** file in *{your_proyect_dir}/data_mappeator/resources*.
