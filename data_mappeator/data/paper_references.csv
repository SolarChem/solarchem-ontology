The Bi2WO6 nanoplates show great potential in the utilization of visible light energy to the highly efficient reduction of CO2 into a renewable hydrocarbon fuel. On the one hand, the ultrathin geometry of the nanoplates promotes charge carriers to move rapidly from the interior to the surface to participate in the photoreduction reaction. This should also favor the improved separation of photogenerated electron and hole and a lower electron&ndash;hole recombination rate; on the other hand, the Bi2WO6 square nanoplate is proven to provide the well-defined {001} facet for two dominantly exposed surfaces, which is a prerequisite for the high level of photocatalytic activity of CO2 fixation.","Y.

This TiO 2 is composed of TiO2 ultrathin nanosheets (2 nm in thickness) with 95% of exposed {100} facet, which is considered to be the active facet for photocatalytic reaction. This percentage (95%) is the highest among previously reported {100} facet exposed anatase TiO2. More importantly, due to this high ratio, our developed TiO2 nanosheets showed marked photocatalytic activity, about 5 times higher activity in both H2 evolution and CO2 reduction than the reference sample, TiO2 cuboids with 53% of exposed {100} facet. For the TiO2 nanosheets, both the higher percentage of exposed {100} facets and larger surface area can offer more surface active sites in the photocatalytic reaction. On the other hand, the superior electronic band structure which results from the higher percentage of {100} facet is also beneficial for the higher activity. This study exemplifies that the facet engineering of semiconductors is one of the most effective strategies to achieve advanced properties over photofunctional materials for solar energy conversion.","H.

When the photon energy matches the plasmon resonance of the Au nanoparticles (free carrier absorption), which is in the visible range (532 nm), we observe a 24-fold enhancement in the photocatalytic activity because of the intense local electromagnetic fields created by the surface plasmons of the Au nanoparticles. These intense electromagnetic fields enhance sub-bandgap absorption in the TiO2, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity in the visible range. When the photon energy is high enough to excite d band electronic transitions in the Au, in the UV range (254 nm), a different mechanism occurs resulting in the production of additional reaction products, including C2H6, CH3OH, and HCHO. This occurs because the energy of the d band excited electrons lies above the redox potentials of the additional reaction products CO2/C2H6, CO2/CH3OH, and CO2/HCHO. We model the plasmon excitation at the Au nanoparticle-TiO2 interface using finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, which provides a rigorous analysis of the electric fields and charge at the Au nanoparticle-TiO2 interface.","W.

It was demonstrated that helium pretreatment of the as-prepared TiO2 at a moderate temperature resulted in the creation of surface oxygen vacancies (VO) and Ti3+ sites on anatase and brookite but not on rutile. The production of CO and CH4 from CO2 photoreduction was remarkably enhanced on defective anatase and brookite TiO2 (up to 10-fold enhancement) as compared to the defect-free surfaces. Defective brookite was photocatalytically more active than anatase and rutile, probably because of a lower formation energy of VO on brookite. The results from in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analyses suggested that (1) defect-free TiO2 was not active for CO2 photoreduction since no CO2&ndash; is generated, and (2) CO2 photoreduction to CO possibly underwent different reaction pathways on oxygen-deficient anatase and brookite via different intermediates (e.g., CO2&ndash; on anatase; CO2&ndash; and HCOOH on brookite). The combined DRIFTS and photoactivity studies reported in this paper have provided new insights to the role of surface defects in CO2 photoreduction on TiO2 nanocrystals, and revealed significant information on the much less studied but promising brookite phase.","L.

One of the best routes to remedy CO2 is to transform it to hydrocarbons using photo reduction. CO2 was photocatalytically reduced to produce methanol using a Hg lamp with wavelength 365 nm in a steady-state optical-fiber photoreactor. The optical-fiber photoreactor, comprised of nearly 120 Cu\/TiO2-coated fibers, was designed and assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly inside the reactor. TiO2 film was coated on optical fiber using a dip-coating method. Cu-loaded titania solutions were prepared by a thermal hydrolysis method. The thickness of Cu\/TiO2 film was 53 nm. The coating film consisted of very fine spherical particles with diameters of near 14 nm. The XRD spectra indicated the anatase phase for all TiO2 and Cu\/TiO2 films. The wavelength of absorption edge on Cu\/TiO2 was near 367 nm, equivalent to a bandgap of 3.3 eV. The most active Cu species on TiO2 surface were Cu2O clusters, and they played an important role for the formation of methanol. The methanol yield increased with UV irradiative intensity. Maximum methanol rate was 0.45 μmole\/g cat h using 1.2 wt.%-Cu\/TiO2 catalyst at 1.29 bar of CO2, 0.026 bar of H2O, and 5000 s mean residence time under 16 W\/cm2 UV irradiation. Higher than 1.2 wt.% Cu loading gave a lower rate of methanol yield because of the masking effect of Cu2O clusters on the TiO2 surface. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model was established by correlating experimental data to describe the kinetic behavior. An optimum pressure ratio of H2O\/CO2 was found in the photo reduction of CO2 for maximum methanol yield.","J.C.S. Wu, H-M. Lin ,C-L. Lai",269,cswu@ntu.edu.tw,"TW,TW,TW","Taiwan,Taiwan,Taiwan",98

NiO loaded InTaO4 photocatalyst was prepared by a solu2013gel method. Aqueous-phase CO2 photoreduction was performed in a quartz reactor to search for the highest photoactivity in a series of NiO/InTaO4 photocatalysts. Thereafter, the best NiO/InTaO4 was dip coated on optical fibers and calcined at 1100u00b0C. A uniform NiO/InTaO4 layer of 0.14u03bcm in thickness was observed on the optical fiber. An optical-fiber photoreactor, comprised of u223c216 NiO/InTaO4-coated fibers, was designed to transmit and spread light uniformly inside the reactor. The UVu2013vis spectra of powder InTaO4 as well as NiO loaded InTaO4 prepared via the same procedure indicated that both photocatalysts could absorb visible light. XRD confirmed that InTaO4 was in single phase. Vapor-phase CO2 was photocatalytically reduced to methanol using the optical-fiber reactor under visible light and real sunlight irradiation in a steady-state flow system. The rate of methanol production was 11.1u03bcmol/gh with light intensity of 327mW/cm2 at 25u00b0C. Increasing the reaction temperature to 75u00b0C increased the production rate to 21.0u03bcmol/gh. Methanol production rate was 11.30u03bcmol/gh by utilizing concentrated sunlight which was comparable to the result of using artificial visible light. The quantum efficiencies were estimated to be 0.0045% and 0.063% in aqueous-phase and optical-fiber reactors, respectively, per gram NiO/InTaO4 photocatalyst. The quantum efficiency increased due to the superior light-energy utilization of NiO/InTaO4 thin film in the optical-fiber reactor.","Z-Y. Wang, H-C. Chou, J.C.S. Wu, D.P. Tsai ,G.

When the Pt-K2Ti6O13 photocatalyst was used under Xe- or Hg-lamp irradiation, H2, CH4, HCHO and HCOOH were formed. On the other hand, when the composite catalyst was used under concentrated sunlight, CH3OH was successfully formed in addition to the above products. For the composite catalyst, H2 resulting from the water decomposition over the photocatalyst serves as the reducing agent for the CO2 hydrogenation over the Cu/ZnO catalyst. The reaction temperature in this study exceeded 580 K due to concentrating the sunlight. Such a high reaction temperature is sufficient for the Cu/ZnO catalyst to reduce CO2 with H2 into CH3OH. It should also be noted that product yields for the photocatalysts were much improved under concentrated sunlight.

Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O in the gaseous phase is studied by using Cu-Fe/TiO2 catalyst coated on optical fibers under UVA and UVC irradiation. Catalyst coated optical fibers are assembled in the reactor such that the UV light can enter along the fibers to conduct the photocatalytic reaction on its surface. Methane and ethylene as main products are observed to evolve from this photoreactor. The presence of Fe as a co-dopant in Cu/TiO2 catalyst is found to synergistically reduce CO2 with H2O to ethylene at the quantum yield and total energy efficiency of 0.024% and 0.016%, respectively. This phenomenon is well explained by an efficient charge transfer mechanism between TiO2 as a support and Cu as well as Fe as co-dopants. Methane is formed more favorably than ethylene on Cu/TiO2. Meanwhile, Fe as a co-dopant on Cu/TiO2 catalyst is found to depress the methane formation. The photo production of ethylene over catalysts supported on optical fibers presents yields that are one order of magnitude higher than that on the glass plate counterpart. For a given amount of catalyst and light energy, the optical-fiber reactor can utilize light energy efficiently.

The films were converted to Ti-containing nanoporous silica thin films by subsequent calcinations in air at 823K, while the highly ordered mesostructures and macroscopic morphology were retained after the surfactant removal by calcination. The films with hexagonal and cubic symmetry were obtained by changing the composition of the starting mixtures. Various spectroscopic measurements of these films clearly showed that Ti ions are present in the silica networks as a tetrahedrally coordinated Ti-oxide species with a high dispersion state. Thus, developed transparent Ti-containing thin films were used as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 with H2O to evaluate their unique and high photocatalytic activity. UV irradiation of these films in the presence of CO2 and H2O led to the formation of CH4 and CH3OH as well as CO and O 2 as minor products, their yields increasing linearly against irradiation time, indicating that these films operate as efficient photocatalysts to proceed such a difficult reaction catalytically at 323K. Furthermore, the films having hexagonal pore structure exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the Ti-MCM-41 powdered catalyst even with the same pore structure.","Y. Shioya , K. Ikeue , M.

In this work, mesoporous silica supported Cu/TiO2 nanocomposites were synthesized through a one-pot sol&ndash;gel method, and the photoreduction experiments were carried out in a continuous-flow reactor using CO2 and water vapor as the reactants under the irradiation of a Xe lamp. The high surface area mesoporous silica substrate (&gt;300m2/g) greatly enhanced CO2 photoreduction, possibly due to improved TiO2 dispersion and increased adsorption of CO2 and H2O on the catalyst. CO was found to be the primary product of CO2 reduction for TiO2&ndash;SiO2 catalysts without Cu. The addition of Cu species, which was identified to be Cu2O by the XPS, markedly increased the overall CO2 conversion efficiency as well as the selectivity to CH4, by suppressing the electron&ndash;hole recombination and enhancing multi-electron reactions. A synergistic effect was observed by combining the porous SiO2 support and the deposition of Cu on TiO2. The peak production rates of CO and CH4 reached 60 and 10&mu;molg-cat&minus;1h&minus;1, respectively, for the 0.5%Cu/TiO2&ndash;SiO2 composite that has the optimum Cu concentration; the peak quantum yield was calculated to be 1.41%.

XPS analysis reveals that Cu 2p 3/2 is 933.4 eV indicating primary Cu 2O species on the TiO 2 supports. EDX and XPS revealed that most copper clusters were on the TiO 2 surface. The optimum amount of copper loading was 2.0 wt.% for the highest dispersion among catalysts. The methanol yield of 2.0 wt.% Cu/TiO 2 was 118 &mu;mol/g following 6 h of UV illumination.

The caustic solution dissolved more CO 2 than did pure water. In addition, the OH &minus; in aqueous solution also served as a strong hole scavenger. The redistribution of the electric charge and the Schottky barrier of Cu and TiO 2 facilitates electron trapping via supported Cu. The photocatalytic efficiency of Cu/TiO 2 was markedly increased because of the lowering the re-combination probability for hole&ndash;electron pairs.

In this reaction system, the Pt/K2Ti6O13 catalyst decomposes water to produce H2 and the Fe-Cu-K/DAY catalyst reduces CO2 with the resulting H2 into organic compounds.

This paper analyses a simple kinetic model incorporating the coupled effect of the adsorptive photocatalytic reduction and oxidation. The development is based on Langmuir&ndash;Hinshelwood mechanism to model the formation rates of hydrogen and methane through photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide with water vapour. Experimental data obtained from literatures have achieved a very good fit. Such model could aid as a tool for related areas of studies. A comparative study using the model developed, showed that product concentration in term of ppm would be an effective measurement of product yields through photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide with water vapour.","S.S.

The accumulation of significant amount of carbonaceous intermediate on the surface followed by deactivation indicated the rate limiting reaction is the water splitting reaction, similar to the natural photosynthetic systems. When gas phase hydrogen was allowed in the system, the carbonaceous intermediates were converted to methane at rates higher than the artificial photosynthesis conditions. In the presence of hydrogen, formation of methane reaction proceeded in the dark albeit at lower rates. The progress of the reaction is very similar to the natural photosynthetic reactions however the rates are seven orders of magnitude slower than the reactions in the natural photosynthetic processes. Furthermore, the role of spilled over hydrogen in the reaction was also demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","D. Uner ,M.M.

The chemical states of Cu in 2wt.% Cu/TiO 2 were characterized in detail as a follow-up the high Cu dispersion found in previous studies. XRD, XPS and XAS analysis reveal that the active Cu state for the photoreaction of CO 2 is suggested to be highly dispersed Cu(I). The photoactivity decreases when Cu(I) changes to Cu(0) or aggregates after reduction with H 2 . An optimal distribution of Cu exists between the surface and bulk of TiO 2 particles. The photocatalytic activity attains maximum when near 25% of the total Cu loading is located on the outermost surface of a TiO 2 particle. Cu/TiO 2 is a more active catalyst than Ag/TiO 2 because Cu particles act as electron trapping sites while still maintain the mobility of photoelectrons.","I-H. Tseng , J.C.S.

The gaseous products extracted were identified using gas chromatography. The results confirmed that CO2 could be reformed in the presence of water vapour and TiO2 pellets into CH4 under continuous UV irradiation at room conditions.

The photocatalysts were studied by TEM, EDX, XRD and XPS to characterize its structure and chemical compostion. Their photocatalytic activities for reducing CO2 to CH3OH under visible light irradiation and the performance for CO2 adsorption were also investigated. The results indicate that the synthetical TNTs photocatalyst is almost in good and uniform shapes, with the diameter of 17.77nm and the surface area of 99.57m^2/g. The amounts adsorbed of CO2 on TNTs are 0.269mmol/g at 1atm pressure and 298K,which are larger than those on other two heterostructure photocatalysts. The adsorption isotherms of CO2 on three photocatalysts can be well described by the Freundlich adsorption equation. The modification of Bi2S3 or CdS can enhance the visible light absorbance and photocatalytic performance of TNTs photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity, the amounts adsorbed of CO2 and visible light absorption capability of Bi2S3-modified TNTs photocatalyst are all better than those of CdS-modified TNTs photocatalyst. Especially, the largest yield of methanol on TNTs photocatalyst modified by Bi2S3 under visible light irradiation over 5h is 224.6@mmol/g, which was about 2.2 times as large as that of TNTs.","X.

Catalysts prepared by different impregnation methods and different Ag loadings (1.5% and 3.0 wt.%) were tested in this process. TEM results show that silver is well dispersed as small nanoparticles (2-3 nm) on Ag/TiO2 samples, while it forms larger crystallites (150-300 nm) on Ag/ZnO catalysts. Optical studies reveal that under UV light irradiation silver nanoparticles are reduced to their metallic state, due to the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the TiO2 conduction band. The formation of Ag-0 leads to the appearance of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. Regarding the photocatalytic activity, both semiconductors (TiO2 and ZnO) are active towards CO2 photoreduction although titania-based catalysts show higher performances. Further, silver incorporation leads to a significant increase in the hydrocarbon production, mainly attributed to lower electron-hole recombination rates. This may explain the observed enhancement of oligomerization processes, especially favoured by the synergetic effect between Ag nanoparticles and TiO2. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Besides, the doping of Ni2+ could further enhance this activity, the optimal content of Ni dopant was about 0.3wt% and the corresponding methyl formate production rate was 121.4?molg-1h-1.

Optical fiber monolith reactor with catalyst coated on the inner surface attracts attention in recent years by its high light utilization ratio. A two-dimensional computational model to describe the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide in a multichannel optical fiber monolith reactor, which had been experimentally investigated, is developed and simulated.

The influence of the deviation of optical fiber installed in the monolith upon the methanol concentration and production efficiency is presented. The results show that the methanol concentration at outlet increases as the inflow water vapor concentration ratio and light intensity input increase, but decreases with increasing the inflow velocity, all of which cause the rise of overall methanol production. With the increase of the optical fiber deviation from the monolith axis, the methanol production efficiency will decrease. Central and straight installation of the optical fiber is recommended either in experiments or scale-up photocatalytic industries.","T. Wong, L. Yong, X. Du ,Y.

The conversion of CO2 using light energy (CO2 photoreduction) has the potential to produce useful fuels or valuable chemicals while decreasing CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels such as coal. Computational studies on the initial steps of photoinduced CO2 activation on TiO2 surfaces, necessary to develop a mechanistic understanding of CO2 photoreduction are a focus of this article.The results from previous quantum mechanical modeling studies conducted by the authors indicated that stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces likely do not promote electron transfer to CO2. Therefore, the role of oxygen vacancies in promoting the light-induced conversion of CO2 (CO2 photoreduction) on TiO2 surfaces was examined in this study. Two different side-on bonded bent-CO2 (bridging Ti&ndash;CO2&delta;&bull;&minus;&ndash;Ti species) were formed on the reduced rutile (110) and anatase (010), (001) surfaces, indicating charge transfer from the reduced surface to CO2. Further steps in the photoexcitation of these bent-CO2 species were investigated with density functional theory calculations. Consistent with CO2 adsorption and photodesorption on other n-type metal oxides such as ZrO2, the results suggest that the bent-CO2 species do not gain further charge from the TiO2 surface under illumination and are likely photodesorbed as neutral species. Additionally, although the formation of species such as CO and HCHO is thermodynamically possible, the energy needed to regenerate the oxygen vacancy on TiO2 surfaces (~7eV) is greater than that available through band-gap illumination (3.2eV). Therefore, CO2 reactions with water on irradiated anatase TiO2 surfaces are likely to be stoichiometric.","V.P. Indrakanti, J.D. Kubicki ,H.H.

In the case of highly dispersed titanium oxide catalysts, the charge transfer excited state, i.e. (Ti3+ O&minus;)3* of the tetrahedral coordinated titanium oxide species was found to play an important role in the appearance of a highly efficient reactivity. The anatase-type TiO2 catalyst with large band gap and numerous surface OH groups showed high efficiency for the formation of CH4. Detection of Ti3+, H, C and CH3 radicals by electron spin resonance at 77 K suggests that the photoreaction of CO2 with H2O proceeds via the formation of CO and C radicals from CO2.

The present study clarified the mechanism of the CO2 photocatalytic reduction in the presence of H2 or CH4 over MgO. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra show that a CO2 molecule adsorbed on MgO was activated to a CO2- radical under photoirradiation. In addition, it was confirmed by photoluminescence that new acceptor level built up between the valence band and the conduction band of MgO on CO2-adsorbed MgO. The CO2- radical was reduced to a surface bidentate formate or a surface bidentate acetate by H2 or CH4 in the dark, respectively. The surface bidentate formate anchors on MgO as a photoactive species and reduces CO2 in the gas phase to CO since the CO2 photocatalytic reduction proceeded over MgO absorbing HCHO or CH3CHO and only 12CO was formed in the presence of 12CO2 over MgO modified by a 13C-labeled formate under irradiation.

The main purpose of this study is to clarify the origin at an electronic level by the density functional simulation for NiO, Ni2O2, Ni3O3, and Ni4O4 clusters supported on TiO2 rutile (110) and anatase (001) surfaces. The clusters adsorb strongly on both rutile and anatase with adsorption energies ranging from &minus;3.18 to &minus;6.15 eV, creating new interfacial bonds between the clusters and both surfaces. On rutile, intermetallic Ni&ndash;Ti bonds facilitate stronger binding compared with anatase. The electronic structure shows that the top of the valence bands (VBs) of rutile and anatase arises from electronic states on the NiO cluster. On the other hand, the conduction band of rutile is from the Ti 3d states, whereas NiO cluster levels are generated near the conduction band minimum of anatase. This is in contrast to the SnO2/rutile TiO2 system, where the density of states near the conduction band minimum increases with the VB unmodified. In the NiO/TiO2 system, the band gaps of both rutile and anatase are narrowed by up to 0.8 eV compared with pristine TiO2, which pushes the photoactivity into the visible region. In view of the calculated electronic structure, we have attributed the enhanced photocataltyic activity both to the charge separation due to the excitation from the Ni 3d surface sub-band to the TiO2 conduction band and the action of the NiO species as a mediator for the electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to O2.","A.

The rate of H2 production in N2-purged aqueous solutions containing 0.1% TiO2 suspension were evaluated to be 0.226 and 5.8 &mu;l/h, without and with 0.5 M 2-propanol, respectively. This confirmed that 2-propanol was an efficient hole scavenger and it scavenged photo-generated holes (h+), allowing its counter ion, viz., e&minus;, to react with water molecule/H+ to yield more H2. The formation of both CO and CH4 in the photolysis of CO2-purged aqueous solutions containing suspended TiO2 in absence of 2-propanol reveal that the generation of CH4 is taking place mainly through CO intermediate. In presence of air/O2, the yield of H2 in the system without 2-propanol was observed to be negligible as compared to the system containing 2-propanol in which low yield of H2 was obtained with a formation rate of approx. 0.5 &mu;l/h.","G.R.

The yields of methane and CO2 were found to be dependent on the light exposure time and ambient conditions. Methane yields were higher in 2-propanol and ethanol systems than in methanol system, showing their better hole-scavenging properties. In the aerated condition, methane was produced during photolysis of all alcohols in the presence of TiO2 and the yield was comparable to those observed in the corresponding CO2-saturated systems. The overall results reveal that the surface adsorbed, as well as in-situ-generated CO2 from photo-oxidation of alcohols are equally responsible for methane formation through photo-reduction in presence of TiO2. In the O2-saturated system, the methane yield was lower as compared to that in aerated system, in contrast to the CO2 yield. In N2O-and N2-purged systems, the yield of methane was observed to be low, inferring that the methane generation has not taken place through photodecomposition/photodissociation of alcohols.

This article focuses on the effects of cocatalysts and reaction modes on photocatalytic behaviors of TiO2 with an emphasis on the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO2 reduction in the presence of H2O, which has been overlooked in most of the published papers. Our results clarified that the reaction using H2O vapor exhibited significantly higher selectivity for CO2 reduction than that by immersing the photocatalyst into liquid H2O. We examined the effect of noble metal cocatalysts and found that the rate of CH4 formation increased in the sequence of Ag < Rh < Au < Pd < Pt, corresponding well to the increase in the efficiency of electron-hole separation. This indicates that Pt is the most effective cocatalyst to extract photogenerated electrons for CO2 reduction. The selectivity of CH4 in CO2 reduction was also enhanced by Pt. The size and loading amount of Pt affected the activity; a smaller mean size of Pt particles and an appropriate loading amount favored the formation of reduction products. The reduction of H2O to H2 was accelerated more than the reduction of CO2 in the presence of Pt, leading to a lower selectivity for CO2 reduction and limited increases in CH4 formation rate. We demonstrated that the addition of MgO into the Pt-TiO2 catalyst could further enhance the formation of CH4. The formation of H2 was suppressed simultaneously, suggesting the increase in the selectivity for CO2 reduction in the presence of MgO. Furthermore, the MgO- and Pt-modified TiO2 catalyst exhibited a higher CH4 selectivity in CO2 reduction.","S. Xie, Y. Wang, Q. Zhang , W. Deng, Y.

However, a challenge lies in the synthesis of metal oxides containing more than one type of metal with specific facets. Usually, surfactants are used to control the crystal morphology, which induces surface contamination for the final products. Here, using the GaOOH nanoplate as precursor, ZnGa2O4 nanocubes with exposed {100} facets are synthesized by an hydrothermal ion-exchange route without requiring the introduction of morphology controlling agents. These ZnGa2O4 nanocubes exhibit improved performance in the photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 or water splitting into hydrogen. Theoretical calculations indicates that the light-hole effective mass on the {100} facets of ZnGa2O4 corresponds to the high hole mobility, which contributes to the efficient water oxidation to offer the protons for promoting CO2 photoreduction into hydrocarbon fuels. ZnGa2O4 nanocubes with exposed {100} facets are synthesized by a hydrothermal ion-exchange reaction using GaOOH precursor nanoplates via a single-crystal to single-crystal phase transformation.

Concerning photocatalysts properties, it was revealed that the inhibiting effect of cerium on the TiO2 crystallites growth occurred only up to 3mol.% of Ce when the incorporation of Ce4+ into the anatase lattice took place. This phenomenon was correlated with the expansion of anatase cell volume. At higher Ce loadings (?5mol.%) the anatase lattice was saturated and the formationseparation of amorphous ceria andor ceria (~1nm) nucleation occurred, accompanied by the increase of TiO2 anatase crystallite-size and the limitation of value of anatase cell volume. Further, it was found out that the mesoporosity of photocatalysts may be preferentially attributed to voids existing between the individual crystallites and thus can be influenced by changes in the crystallite size. The modification of TiO2 with cerium affected also the spectral response of photocatalysts, shifting it to the visible light region. However, this property itself was not crucial in the CO2 photocatalytic reduction.

Herein we demonstrate that Pt-loading can reverse the photocatalytic activity order of anatase TiO2 {001} facets (TiO2-001) and {010} facets (TiO2-010) for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. This new phenomenon was discussed on the bases of the experimental data including attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-IR) spectra, CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) curves, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra. It is found that the higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of TiO2-010 without Pt-loading can be attributed to its larger CO2 adsorbed amount and longer charge lifetime as compared with TiO2-001, while the Pt nanoparticles loaded on TiO2-001 can more efficiently enhance the photoinduced carrier separation efficiency than that on TiO2-010, and therefore resulting in a photoactivity higher than the Pt-loaded TiO2-001. The above results provide an important indication about the effects of Pt-loading on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of anatase TiO2 with different exposed facets, and shed light on the fabrication of novel nanostructured photocatalysts through morphological control for high conversion efficiency in the CO2 resource utilization.","J.

Furthermore, by comparing different halide ions, the photoactivity of 30AgBrpCN was higher (by a factor of 1.3) than that of the optimal 30AgClpCN. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was accredited to (1) the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect from Ag and (2) the formation of heterojunction structure between pCN and AgBr in the AgBrpCN hybrid photocatalysts for efficient charge transfer and separation to retard the recombination process as evidenced by the photoluminescence analysis. The effective charge separation was attributed to the matching of electronic band potentials of pCN and AgBr, exhibiting the Type II heterojunction, in comparison to that of AgClpCN (Type I heterojunction).

Pure oxygen-rich TiO2 (O2-TiO2) was first prepared via a simple aqueous peroxo-titanate route. The as-prepared photocatalyst was shown to exhibit reduced band gap energy and visible-light-active characteristics. However, the photoactivity of bare O<inf>2<inf>-TiO<inf>2<inf> was found to gradually deteriorate over time. Hence, by exploiting its unique properties, graphene oxide (GO) was subsequently incorporated with the O2TiO<inf>2<inf> photocatalyst.

The definitive role of groups such as N-N from the nitrogen-source on the surface of as-prepared samples in the selectivity of the dominant product of photocatalytic reduction is demonstrated. Well-crystallized one-dimensional N-TiO2 nanorod arrays with a preferred orientation of the rutile (3 1 0) facet are manufactured via a hydrothermal treatment using hydrazine and ammonia variously as the source of nitrogen. Significant selectivity of the dominant reduced products has been exhibited for N-TiO2 prepared from different nitrogen-sources in carbon dioxide photocatalytic reduction under visible light illumination. CH4 is the main product with N2H4-doped N-TiO2, while CO is the main product with NH3-doped N-TiO2, which can be attributed to the existence of the reducing N-N groups in the N2H4-doped N-TiO2 surfaces after the hydrothermal treatment. Compared with the approaches previously reported, the facile one-step route utilized here accomplishes the fabrication of N-TiO2 possessing visible-light activity and attainment of selectivity of dominant photocatalytic reduction product simultaneously by choosing a nitrogen-source with appropriate chemical bond form, which provides a completely new approach to understanding the effects of doping treatment on photocatalytic properties."," Z.

The MgO–TiO2 microspheres were fabricated by two methods: (1) a one-step spray pyrolysis method using TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles dispersed in Mg(NO3)2 solution as the precursors (Mg\/Ti-SP), and (2) spray pyrolysis synthesis of pure TiO2 (P25) microspheres first and then wet-impregnation with MgO (Mg\/Ti-WI). The two material synthesis methods led to different MgO dispersion on the TiO2 surface. For Mg\/Ti-SP, the strong aggregation of MgO nanoparticles caused a rough surface of the MgO–TiO2 microsphere; while for Mg\/Ti-WI, MgO was more uniformly deposited leading to a much smoother surface of the microsphere. The surface dispersion of MgO was found to significantly affect the performance of MgO–TiO2 in CO2 photoreduction. At the same MgO concentration, Mg\/Ti-SP had more than two times higher activity than Mg\/Ti-WI, and most importantly, little deactivation of the catalyst was observed on Mg\/Ti-SP while Mg\/Ti-WI started to deactivate after 1 to 2 h when the reactor was operating in a continuous flow mode. The ease of photo-induced electron transfer to the catalyst surface may have contributed to the superb activity of Mg\/Ti-SP samples.

Additionally, a synergetic photocatalytic mechanism is proposed to understand the mechanism of plasmon enhanced photocatalysis based on the experimental results under different conditions.","E.

The CO2 reduction results further confirmed this special reduction ability of Mo-doped TNTs, which produced much higher yields of methane and carbon monoxide. The photocatalytic reaction results of both NO2 and CO2 showed that Mo-doped TNTs prepared by the precipitation method provided the highest reduction ability, which may be due to its chemical oxidation states of Mo4+ and Mo5+.","N.

Compared with pure g-C3N4, the resulting Pt-loaded g-C3N4 (PtCN) exhibited a considerable improvement in the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 in the presence of water vapor at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure under visible light irradiation. 2 wt% Pt-loaded g-C3N4 (2PtCN) nanocomposites produced the highest CH4 yield of 13.02 ?mol gcatalyst -1 after 10 h of light irradiation, which was a 5.1-fold enhancement in comparison with pure g-C3N4 (2.55 ?mol gcatalyst -1). The remarkable photocatalytic activity of PtCN nanostructures in the CH4 production was ascribed to the enhanced visible light absorption and efficient interfacial transfer of photogenerated electrons from g-C3N4 to Pt due to the lower Fermi level of Pt in the PtCN hybrid heterojunctions as evidenced by the UV-Vis and photoluminescence studies. The enriched electron density on Pt favored the reduction of CO2 to CH4via a multi-electron transfer process. This resulted in the inhibition of electron-hole pair recombination for effective spatial charge separation, thus enhancing the photocatalytic reactions.

In the present work, the main products of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in aqueous TiO2 suspensions were found to be methane, methanol, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and H2. Anatase TiO2 catalysts with various morphologies, such as nanoparticle, nanotube, and nanosheet, were synthesized through a hydrothermal method. The TiO2 nanosheets were more active than the nanotubes or nanoparticles in the reduction of CO2 in aqueous solution. This is because the photogenerated carriers prefer to flow to the specific facets. The TiO2 sheet with high-energy exposed {001} facets facilitates the oxidative dissolution of H2O with photogenerated holes, leaving more photogenerated electrons available for the reduction of CO2 on {101} facets. Moreover, surface fluorination promotes the formation of Ti3+ species, which is helpful in the reduction of CO2 to CO2 - and in extending the lifetime of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The optimum ratio of exposed {001} to {101} facets for surface-fluorinated TiO2 nanosheets was found to be ?72:28, which corresponds to an initial FTi ratio of 1.

The metal doping influenced strongly the crystal structure as well as the photocatalytic activity of the oxides. The XRD data could prove that the Mo(V) doping induces the orthorhombic phase, while the Cr(III) doping favors the triclinic phase for both oxides. Metal doping also modified the photosensitivity of the oxides, extending the absorption toward the visible light region. The photocatalytic activity in water splitting under visible light irradiation was evaluated by monitoring the H2, CO2 and CO evolution. The results showed that Cr(III)-doped BiTaO4 and BiNbO4, in general, are more selective for hydrogen production, while Mo(V)-doped materials are more selective for CO2 generation.

However, oxidation potential of g-C3N4 is not enough for water oxidation. Therefore, we focused on hybridization of g-C 3N4 and tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3) which has high oxidation potential for water oxidation. In this study, we examined CO 2 reduction by composite photocatalyst of g-C3N 4 and WO3, which was prepared by three methods (mixture using an agate mortar, impregnation and planetary mill). As a result, composite photocatalyst prepared with planetary mill showed the highest photocatalytic activity. Photodeposition of silver or gold nanoparticles only on g-C 3N4 of the hybrid photocatalyst induced an increase in CH3OH because the loaded metal nanoparticles play an important role in multi-electron reduction of CO2. Photocatalytic activity of the Au-loaded hybrid photocatalyst composed of g-C3N4 and WO3 was 1.7-times higher than that of the hybrid photocatalyst without Au loading. In addition, we investigated photocatalytic reaction mechanism of composite photocatalyst by double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy. This result revealed Z-scheme reaction proceeds in the composite photocatalyst to maintain high oxidation ability of WO3 and high reduction ability of g-C3N4, resulting in high photocatalytic activity.","T.

However, the main factors that induce the enhanced photocatalytic performance of H-TiO2 are still under debate. In order to clarify this issue, the structural properties of H-TiO2, and their effects on photo-generated charges are comprehensively investigated in this study. H-TiO2 nanoparticles with different hydrogenation degrees are rapidly synthesized through H2 plasma treatment in several minutes; and their photocatalytic activities are evaluated by methylene blue (MB) degradation and CO2 reduction in aqueous and gaseous media, respectively.

Further investigations reveal that the higher ratio of trapped holes (O- centers) and a lower recombination rate induced by the increase of surface defects might be the critical factors for the high activity of s-H-TiO2; in contrast, h-H-TiO2 nanoparticles possess high concentration of bulk defects, leading to a significantly decreased amount of O- centers and enhanced non-radiative recombination, which strongly inhibit their photoactivity.

These composite samples exhibited a high activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4, even without a noble metal Pt co-catalyst. The optimized RGO-CdS nanorod composite photocatalyst exhibited a high CH4-production rate of 2.51 ?mol h-1 g-1 at an RGO content of 0.5 wt%. This rate exceeded that observed for the pure CdS nanorods by more than 10 times and was better than that observed for an optimized Pt-CdS nanorod composite photocatalyst under the same reaction conditions. This high photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the deposition of CdS nanorods onto the RGO sheets, which act as an electron acceptor and transporter, thus efficiently separating the photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, the introduction of RGO can enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules, which speeds up the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4.

The active photocatalysts are prepared by adsorption of either aqueous Pd-β-cyclodextrin colloids (Pd(β-CD)), synthesized at 60°C, or aqueous Pd(citrate) colloids onto TiO2 powders or colloids. Illuminated Pd-free TiO2 suspensions, in the presence of CO2\/HCO3- and the electron donor oxalate, generate H2 and a small amount of formate; formate is formed at a rate of 3.7 × 10-3 μmol min-1. With Pd(β-CD,60°C)-TiO2 and Pd(citrate)-TiO2 suspensions, the photoconversion of CO2\/HCO3- to formate occurs at rates of 2.3 × 10-2 and 3.7 × 10-2 μmol min-1, respectively. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2\/HCO3- to HCO2- is inhibited by mercaptoethanol. Concomitant with the decline in formate production, the rate of H2 production increases. The inhibition of CO2\/HCO3- reduction is attributed to the binding of mercaptoethanol to the HCO3--activation sites of Pd. The Pd(β-Cd,60°C)-TiO2 particles also catalyze the dark hydrogenation of CO2\/HCO3- by H2 and the oxidation of formate by methyl viologen. A mechanism is invoked in which the photogenerated conduction-band electrons of TiO2 either directly reduce protons to H2 on the semiconductor surface or else reduce protons on the Pd surface to produce palladium hydride. The latter species reduces the Pd-activated HCO3- to formate.","Z. Goren, I. Willner, A. J. Nelson, A. J. Frank",94,artleafs.admin@artleafs.eu,"IL,IL,US,US","Israel,Israel,USA,USA",603

Although photocatalyst OPP-3 itself concurrently undergoes photo-Birch reduction during the photocatalysis, the turnover number for the formation of HCO2- based on the reacted OPP-3 is calculated to be 4, implying a cyclic activity of the reduction system. The laser flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis studies reveal that the photocatalysis initially starts from the reductive quenching of the singlet state of OPP-n by TEA followed by the formation of the radical anion of OPP-n, OPP-n.-, resulting in direct electron transfer from OPP-n.- to CO2 molecules.","S.

A cross link of GR nanosheets and a homogeneous coating of TiO2 onto the self assembled GR surfaces are simultaneously achieved by functionalizing the GR surface with benzyl alcohol. Followed by thermal treatment in air, the 2D TiO2 structure with ultralarge lateral size far beyond the size of original GR nanosheets (several hundred nanometers) has been built with GR as a sacrificial template. The resultant TiO2 nanosheets (TiO2 NS) are then homogeneously photodeposited with CdS nanocrystals, and thus the CdS TiO2 composite nanosheets (CdS TiO2 NS) are obtained. Using simulated solar light as energy source, the CdS TiO2 NS exhibits much higher activity than that of bare TiO2 NS toward selective gas phase reduction of CO2 and liquid phase reduction of nitroaromatics. The improved photocatalytic activities of CdS TiO2 NS benefits from (1) the deposition of narrow band gap CdS can effectively extend the light absorption range of wide band gap TiO2 NS and (2) the unique 2D structure of TiO2 NS provides abundant coupling interface for CdS decoration, which is beneficial for photogenerated charge carrier transport across the interfacial domain.

Fabrication of oxygen-deficient surfaces is an important strategy for enhancing CO2 photoreduction activity. However, regeneration of the oxygen vacancies in photocatalysts is still a problem since an oxygen vacancy will be filled up by the O atom from CO2 after the dissociation process. Herein, we have fabricated highly efficient BiOCl nanoplates with photoinduced oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies were easily regenerated by light irradiation due to the high oxygen atom density and low Bi-O bond energy even when the oxygen vacancies had been filled up by the O atom in the photocatalytic reactions. These oxygen vacancies not only enhanced the trapping capability for CO2, but also enhanced the efficiency of separation of electron-hole pairs, which resulted in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction under simulated solar light. Furthermore, the generation and recovery of the defects in the BiOCl could be realized during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in water. The existence of photoinduced defects in thin BiOCl nanoplates undoubtedly leads to new possibilities for the design of solar-driven bismuth based photocatalysts.","L. Zhang, W. Wang, D. Jiang, E.

The results show that in situ Cu deposition leads to in situ formation of abundant oxygen vacancies (Vo) on the surface of the TiO2 nanosheets. Interestingly, the co-existence of Vo and Cu2O clusters could promote the photoactivity of CO2 reduction efficiently. The surface Vo play a significant role in the reduction of CO2. Meanwhile, the deposited Cu(i) species serve also as active sites for the formation of CH4, and then protect CH4 from degradation by generated oxidation species. For the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4, it is found that the content level of Cu2O has a significant influence on the activity. Cu-TiO2-1.0 shows the highest photocatalytic activity, which is over 30 times higher than that of the parent TiO2. This great enhancement of photocatalytic activity may be contributed by high CO2 adsorption capacity, high electron mobility, and high concentration of Vo.

The resulting TiO2 sponge exhibits about a 2.60 fold improvement in CO2 photoconversion rate (CH4: 5.13 ppm h-1) compared to the referred TiO2 (1.97 ppm h-1) formed in the absence of the LRS.

The higher photocatalytic activity of the macromesoporous TiO2 sponge can be attributed to the following three reasons: (1) macroporous architecture favors gas diffusion of the reactants and the products; (2) macroporous architecture also promotes the multiple-reflection effect occurring inside the interior macrocavities, which enables trapping (or harvest) the incident light in the photocatalyst for a longer duration and bring forth more opportunities for light absorption; and (3) the mesoporous structure enhances gas captureadsorption of the reactants and provides more reaction sites.","F.

However, the previously reported highly active facets for monoclinic WO3 were mainly toward enhancing photocatalytic reductions. Here we report that the WO3 with {100} facet orientation and tuned surface electronic band structure can effectively enhance photocatalytic oxidation properties. The {100} faceted WO3 single crystals are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The UV–visible diffuse reflectance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band spectra, and photoelectrochemical measurements suggest that the {100} faceted WO3 has a much higher energy level of valence band maximum compared with the normal WO3 crystals without preferred orientation of the crystal face. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the shift of O 2p and W 5d states in {100} face induce a unique band structure. In comparison with the normal WO3, the {100} faceted WO3 exhibits an O2 evolution rate about 5.1 times in water splitting, and also shows an acetone evolution rate of 4.2 times as well as CO2 evolution rate of 3.8 times in gaseous degradation of 2-propanol.

The photocatalytic performance of bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is usually limited by its low surface area and rapid charge carrier recombination. To develop g-C3N4 more suitable for photocatalysis, researchers have to enlarge its surface area and accelerate the charge carrier separation. In this work, novel hybrid graphitic carbon nitride and carbon (H-g-C3N4\/C) composites with various carbon contents have been developed for the first time by a facile one-step pyrolysis method using melamine and natural soybean oil as precursors. The effect of carbon content on the structure of H-g-C3N4\/C composites and the catalytic activity for the photoreduction of CO2 with H2O were investigated. The results indicated that the introduction of carbon component can effectively improve the textural properties and electronic conductivity of the composites, which exhibited imporved photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 with H2O in comparison with bulk g-C3N4.

The photoreduction ability of a semiconductor is closely correlated to its conduction band (CB) position. A homogeneous-phase solid-solution with the same crystal system always has a monotonously changed CB position, and the high CB level has to be sacrificed to achieve a benign photoabsorption. Herein, we report the fabrication of heterogeneous-phase solid-solution ZnXCa1–XIn2S4 between trigonal ZnIn2S4 and cubic CaIn2S4. The ZnXCa1–XIn2S4 solid solutions with orderly tuned photoresponsive range from 540 to 640 nm present a more negative CB level and highly enhanced charge-separation efficiency. Profiting from these merits, all of these ZnXCa1–XIn2S4 solid solutions exhibit remarkably strengthened photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. Zn0.4Ca0.6In2S4, bearing the most negative CB position and highest charge-separation efficiency, casts the optimal photocatalytic CH4 and CO evolution rates, which reach 16.7 and 6.8 times higher than that of ZnIn2S4 and 7.2 and 3.9 times higher than that of CaIn2S4, respectively. To verify the crucial role of the heterogeneous-phase solid solution in promoting the band structure and photocatalytic performance, another heterogeneous-phase solid-solution ZnXCd1–XIn2S4 has been synthesized. It also displays an upshifted CB level and promoted charge separation.

Here rutile TiO2 nanoparticles having 5–10 nm in size were employed as modifiers to improve interfacial charge transfer between semiconducting carbon nitride nanosheets (NS-C3N4) and a supramolecular Ru(II)–Re(I) binuclear complex (RuRe). The RuRe\/TiO2\/NS-C3N4 hybrid was capable of photocatalyzing CO2 reduction into CO with high selectivity under visible light (λ > 400 nm), outperforming an analogue without TiO2 by a factor of 4, in terms of both CO formation rate and turnover number (TON). The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed primarily to prolonged lifetime of free and\/or shallowly trapped electrons generated in TiO2\/NS-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation, as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy. Experimental results also indicated that the TiO2 modifier served as a good adsorption site for RuRe, which resulted in the suppression of undesirable desorption of the complex, thereby contributing to the improved photocatalytic performance.

The described film functioned as a free-standing plate without any bias potential application, similar to a natural leaf. The film was facilely fabricated by a simple hydrothermal and annealing treatment of a titanium substrate to produce the SrTiO3 nanorod film (STO film) followed by two steps of loading the reduction and oxidation cocatalysts onto the surface of the STO. As a reduction cocatalyst, a CuxO nanocluster was chosen to achieve selective reduction of CO2 into CO, whereas a cobalt- and phosphate-based cocatalyst (CoPi) facilitated oxidation on the STO surface to promote oxygen generation. For the photocatalysis test, a wireless film was simply set into an aqueous solution bubbled with CO2 in a reactor, and CO production was observed in the headspace of the reactor under UV irradiation. Compared to the bare STO film, the dual cocatalyst-loaded STO film exhibited 2.5 times higher CO generation. H2 production was very limited in our system, and the amount of molecules generated by the reduction reaction was almost twice that of the generated oxygen molecules, proving that water molecules acted as electron donors. Our artificial leaf consists of abundant and nontoxic natural elements and represents the first achievement of stoichiometric CO2 reduction using water as an electron donor by a free-standing natural leaflike plate form.","S.

A detailed investigation of 2-propanol oxidation as a model reaction revealed significant differences between the reactivities of the WO3 and TiO2 systems. On TiO2 photocatalysts, complete decomposition to CO2 proceeded readily, due to the occurrence of direct oxidation of 2-propanol and acetone adsorbed by holes, resulting in significantly low selectivity for partial oxidation. On the other hand, the rates of acetone peroxidation on WO3 photocatalysts were much lower than those on TiO2 due to the low affinity of the WO3 surface to the substrates, particularly acetone. The low affinity of the WO3 surface also enables preferential generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) from water, which react with 2-propanol much more efficiently than with acetone, further increasing selectivity for acetone in the WO3 system. Most importantly, the loading of a palladium oxide cocatalyst on WO3 drastically improved the selectivity for acetone by almost completely suppressing the peroxidation of acetone during photoirradiation. A considerable amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was confirmed to accumulate during photoirradiation on PdOx\/WO3 due to the high selectivity of the PdOx cocatalyst for the two-electron reduction of O2 molecules, while such accumulation was not observed for Pt\/WO3. The H2O2 in the PdOx\/WO3 system preferentially reacted with photogenerated holes when the concentrations of acetone and H2O2 increased, suppressing the peroxidation of acetone by the holes. The PdOx\/WO3 photocatalyst was more selective for partial oxidation of other alcohols than other photocatalysts, while the selectivity depended on the alcohols used, suggesting the availability of the unique reactivity of the PdOx\/WO3 photocatalyst for partial oxidation of various organic compounds.","O.

However, there still lacks fundamental understanding of the role of the vacancies in semiconductor materials. Herein, the g-C3N4 nanosheets with tunable nitrogen vacancies are prepared as the photocatalysts for H2 evolution and CO2 reduction to CO. On the basis of both experimental investigation and DFT calculations, nitrogen vacancies in g-C3N4 induce the formation of midgap states under the conduction band edge. The position of midgap states becomes deeper with the increasing of nitrogen vacancies. The g-C3N4 nanosheets with the optimized density of nitrogen vacancies display about 18 times and 4 times enhancement for H2 evolution and of CO2 reduction to CO, respectively, as compared to the bulk g-C3N4. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of several factors including (1) nitrogen vacancies cause the excitation of electrons to midgap states below the conduction band edge, which results in extension of the visible light absorption to photons of longer wavelengths (up to 598 nm); (2) the suitable midgap states could trap photogenerated electrons to minimize the recombination loss of photogenerated electron–hole pairs; and (3) nitrogen vacancies lead to uniformly anchored small Pt nanoparticles (1–2 nm) on g-C3N4, and facilitate the electron transfer to Pt. However, the overintroduction of nitrogen vacancies generates deeper midgap states as the recombination centers, which results in deterioration of photocatalytic activities.

To verify this hypothesis, the La2O3 is decorated on surface of LaTiO2N with oxygen vacancies, achieving a twofold increase in CH4 yield rate for CO2 reduction. The prominent activity results from the following two effects: (1) The O2− in La2O3 as basic sites favors CO2 chemisorption in the form of CO32− species, greatly contributing to both the bending of O[BOND]C[BOND]O bond and the decrease of the lowest unoccupied molecule orbit energy of CO2 molecule. (2) The oxygen vacancies on LaTiO2N are beneficial in activating H2O to adsorbed OH, thus effectively decreasing the reaction barriers of water oxidation to release protons.

The structure and the physicochemical properties of the as-prepared SAPO-5 nanosheets were characterized in detail. The SAPO-5 ultrathin nanosheets have great potential applications for the highly efficient reduction of CO2 into a renewable hydrocarbon fuel. Compared with SAPO-5 microrods, the ultrathin SAPO-5 nanosheets show higher photocatalytic activity (about 6 times) for reducing CO2 into CH4. It is found that a large number of surface active sites on the nanosheets make it suitable for the catalytic reaction, and the ultrathin geometry of the nanosheets promotes the mass transfer of reactants and products. The normalized time-resolved fluorescence decay signals of the photo-induced absorption recorded from the SAPO-5 nanosheets and rod indicate that the excited state can survive longer on the nanosheets, which also contributes to its high photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, high CO2 adsorption capacity may be one important reason for high photocatalytic activity of SAPO-5 nanosheets. The reaction intermediates are detected by in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy.

Because of the cooperative effects of nanostructural design and surface grafting, the optimized ZIF-8 modified tubular g-C3N4 photocatalysts exhibit a great enhancement in photocatalytic CH3OH production efficiency by more than 3 times, relative to the bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) photocatalyst synthesized by conventional pyrolysis of melamine.

In this study, we used Ti-substituted hydroxyapatite (TiHAP), an emerging photocatalytic material with a high adsorption capacity, as a novel photocatalyst to investigate the photocatalytic reduction of gaseous CO2 under ultraviolet (UV) light with water as the reductant. Powders of TiHAP and fluorine-doped TiHAP (TiFHAP) were prepared using a hydrothermal method, and their morphologies, structure, and composition were characterized via transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV–Vis spectrophotometry, photoluminescence fluorescent spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Compared to commercial P25-TiO2, TiHAP provided enhanced photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4), due to its higher conduction band position. Fluorine doping further facilitated the reaction activity of TiFHAP, with 5.6 wt% fluorine providing the optimal results. The relative humidity of the reaction system had a substantial effect on the CO2 reduction process. Higher relative humidity ensured greater participation of protons, which was confirmed by the increasing formation rates of CO and CH4. Furthermore, a high CO formation rate always accompanied high CH4 formation selectivity, indicating that deep CO2 reduction can proceed rapidly over TiFHAP samples. This study supports the idea that TiHAP may be a novel and efficient photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2.","X. Wang,X. Feng,J. Shang,Y. Jin,C.

The selectivity toward the evolution of CO over H2 can be controlled by varying the addition of Zn species in the Ag-loaded Zn-modified Ga2O3 photocatalyst. The production of H2 gradually decreased with increasing amounts of Zn species from 0.1 to 10.0 mol%, whereas the evolution of CO was almost unchanged. The XRD, XAFS, and XPS measurements revealed that a ZnGa2O4 layer was generated on the surface of Ga2O3 by modification with the Zn species. The formation of the ZnGa2O4 layer eliminated the proton reduction sites on Ga2O3, although the crystallinity, surface area, morphology of Ga2O3, the particle size, and chemical state of Ag did not change.

The rates of the two reactions largely depend on the type of photocatalyst and exhibit an almostparallel behaviour, both being higher with photocatalysts containing noble metal nanoparticles. How-ever, the yields in CH4, CO and other products obtained from photocatalytic CO2reduction still remainvery low and often decline during the runs. Furthermore, methane was found to be produced underirradiation when the photocatalysts were contacted with a gas phase containing water vapour and nocarbon dioxide. This points to a major role of carbon-containing impurities on the photocatalyst surface,which may act both as hole scavengers and as carbon source. Two step photocatalytic tests, i.e. a cleaningstep in the presence of water vapour followed by purging of the gas phase and a second step after CO2addition, allow one to discern between the carbon-containing gaseous products originated from carbonimpurities and those produced in the presence of CO2.

A photosensitizing site (Ru(PS)) was introduced by treating cis-[Ru(bpy)2(dimethylsulfoxide)Cl]Cl with BPy-PMO. Then a catalytic site (Ru(Cat)) was brought in Ru(PS)x-BPy-PMO by reaction with a ruthenium polymer [Ru(CO)2Cl2]n. The stepwise modification of BPy-PMO successfully affords a novel photocatalyst Ru(PS)x-Ru(Cat)y-BPy-PMO. The molar fractions (x, y) of Ru(PS) and Ru(Cat) were determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurement and quantification of the amount of CO emitted in the photo-decarbonylation of Ru(Cat), respectively. Photochemical CO2 reduction (λex>430 nm) by Ru(PS)x-Ru(Cat)y-BPy-PMO in a CO2-saturated N,N-dimethylacetamide\/water solution containing 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide catalytically produced CO and formate. The total turnover frequency of CO and formate reached more than 162 h−1 on x=0.11 and y=0.0055. The product selectivity (CO\/formate) became large when the ratio of Ru(PS)-to-Ru(Cat) (x\/y) was increased. The photocatalysts can be recycled at least three times without losing their catalytic activity, demonstrating that the Ru(PS) and Ru(Cat) units were strongly immobilized on the BPy-PMO framework.","Y.

In photocatalytic-AOPs, an appropriate concentration of p-Cresol was mixed with certain amount of ZnO in 500 mL deionized water according to an experimental-design. Then the mixture was irradiated by UV-A lamp at different pH for 6 h. At specific time intervals, the sampling was carried out to calculate the efficiency of the photodegradation. Therefore, the photodegradation as a system consists of four input variables such irradiation time, pH, amount of ZnO and p-Cresol’s concentration while the only output was the efficiency. In this work, the system was modeled and optimized by semi-empirical response surface methodology. To obtain the empirical responses, the design was performed in laboratory. Then observed responses were fitted with several well-known models by regression process to suggest a provisional model. The suggested model which was validated by several statistical evidence, predicted the desirable condition with higher efficiency. The predicted condition consisted of irradiation time (280 min), pH (7.9), photocatalyst (1.5 g L−1), p-Cresol (95 mg L−1) and efficiency (95%) which confirmed by further experiments.

The controlled crystallites growth with increased specific surface area and reduced pore diameter were observed by NiO and In2O3 loading into TiO2. In and Ni metals present in TiO2, oxidized as In2O3 and NiO, promoted efficient separation of photo-generated charges (e-\/h+). Using H2O as a reductant, CO2 was efficiently converted to CH4 over co-loaded TiO2 catalysts and the optimal loading amount was determined to be 1 wt.% NiO and 3 wt.% In2O3, giving a CH4 production rate of 240 μmole g-1 h-1 at selectivity 80%. This photoactivity of NiO and In2O3 loaded TiO2 catalyst for CO2 methanation was 2 fold more than the yield rate over In2O3\/TiO2 and 6.5 times more the amount produced over the pure TiO2. The enhancement was attributed to charge transfer property and efficient suppressed recombination rate by Ni and In metals. In the presence of H2 reductant, both CO and CH4 were produced in significant amount and the maximum yield rates detected were 243 and 208 μmole g-1 h-1, respectively. Therefore, H2O reductant found to be more efficient for CH4 production, yet the CO2 reduction process was more favorable with H2, where the total amounts of products were considerably enhanced.

For the first time, these SnNb2O6 nanosheets are applied into the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4 in th absence of co-catalysts and sacrificial agents under visible light irradiation. The structure features, morphology, photoabsorption performance, and photoelectric response have been investigated in detail. Results show the as-prepared SnNb2O6 samples with typical 2D nanosheet in the thickness of about 1 nm. Owing to the unique features of the nanosheets, the surface area, photoelectrical property and the surface basicity of SnNb2O6 are greatly improved compared with the counterpart prepared by traditional solid state reaction. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity of CO2 on SnNb2O6 nanosheets is much higher than that of layered SnNb2O6. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of SnNb2O6 nanosheets for the reduction of CO2 is about 45 and 4 times higher than those of the references (layered SnNb2O6 and common N-doped TiO2), respectively. To understand the interaction between the CO2 molecule and the surface of photocatalyst, and the reactive species in the reduction process, the intermediates have also been detected by in situ FTIR with and without visible light irradiation.

It is thus found that the energetic difference between the band gap energy of the semiconductor and the position of the plasmon is influencing the photocatalytic activity. Potentially, plasmon excitation due to visible light absorption results in plasmon resonance energy, which affects the excitation of the semiconductor positively. Therefore, an overlap between band gap energy of the semiconductor and metal plasmon is needed.","M. Dilla,A. Pougin,J. Strunk",26,jennifer.strunk@cec.mpg.de,"DE,DE,DE",,526

Ba loading brought about a distorted structure of BiFeO3 magnetic nanoparticles (BFO MNPs) consisting of small, randomly oriented and non-uniform grains, leading to increased surface area and improved magnetic and photocatalytic activities. Doping of Ba2+ into pure BFO (Bi1_x Bax FeO3, x = 0.2 mol %) greatly increased magnetic saturation to 3.0 emu\/g and significantly decreased the band-gap energy to 1.79 eV, as compared to 2.1 emu\/g and 2.1 eV, respectively, for pure BFO. Bi1-xBa xFeO3 of x = 0.2 mol % exhibited the greatest photocatalytic degradation effect after 60 min of visible light irradiation, and reached 97% benzene removal efficiency, leading to production of a high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), with 93% and 82% reductions in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC), respectively. The identified major intermediate products of photodegradation enabled prediction of the proposed benzene degradation pathway. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of benzene removal is due to both mechanisms, photocatalytic and photo-Fenton catalytic degradation.","T.

Studies reveal that the as-prepared Zr-MOF shows desirable characteristics including excellent chemical and thermal stability, high CO2 uptake, broad-band visible light absorption and efficient photoinduced charge generation. Remarkably, NNU-28 is highly efficient for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction with a formate formation rate of 183.3 μmol h−1 mmolMOF−1, which is among the highest performances of Zr-MOFs. Both photocatalytic experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies reveal that both the inorganic building unit Zr6 oxo cluster and the anthracene-based ligand contribute to the highly efficient photocatalysis of CO2 reduction.

The carbon content of the carbon@TiO2 composites was adjusted by changing the duration of the final calcination step, and was shown to significantly affect the physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity of the composites. The optimized carbon@TiO2 composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction compared with commercial TiO2 (P25): the photocatalytic CH4 production rate (4.2 μmol g–1 h–1) was twice that of TiO2; moreover, a large amount of CH3OH was produced (at a rate of 9.1 μmol g–1 h–1). The significantly improved photocatalytic activity was not only due to increased specific surface area (110 m2 g–1) and CO2 uptake (0.64 mmol g–1), but also to a local photothermal effect around the photocatalyst caused by the carbon. More importantly, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) showed remarkable enhancement of light absorption owing to the incorporation of visiblelight- active carbon core with UV light-responsive TiO2 shell for increased solar energy utilization. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) revealed that the carbon content can influence the charge transfer efficiency of the carbon@TiO2 composites.

To understand the role of a Pt cocatalyst, chemisorption energies of HCOO and OH on TiO2(110) are investigated with and without a Pt cluster.

In this work, core-shell structured TiO2@SiO2 composites have been synthesized via a simple sol-gel method under ambient temperature and pressure, and applied to photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O in gas-phase under simulated solar light irradiation. The results show that as compared to bare TiO2, TiO2@SiO2 composites exhibit significantly enhanced adsorption capacity of CO2 and facilitated photogenerated charge carriers separation, and thereby enhanced photoactivity toward CO2 reduction. Although the insulating nature of SiO2 inhibits the charge injection from inner TiO2 core through the silica layer to the outer surface, the separation efficiency of charge carriers within the inner pore structure of TiO2@SiO2 is facilitated due to the as-formed Ti-O-Si bonds. In particular, TiO2@30%SiO2, which balances the combined influence of the CO2 adsorption and charge carriers separation, acquires the best photoactivity and the high selectivity for CO formation. This can be ascribed to the enriched density of adsorbed CO2 and relatively lower electron density on the reactive sites of the samples. In addition, in contrast to bare TiO2, the competitive process of H2 formation is greatly inhibited over TiO2@SiO2 composites. It is hoped that our work could inspire ongoing interest in utilizing the SiO2 coating method as well as other proper core-shell strategy to tune the activity and selectivity of semiconductor-based materials for artificial photoreduction of CO2 to value-added solar fuels.","L.

It was proved that increasing amount of cerium ions in TiO2 (1) decreased the anatase crystallite size, which corresponded to the increase in specific surface area of the photocatalysts, and (2) decreased the absorption edge (shifting the spectral response toward the visible light region). The prepared photocatalysts were tested for CO2 photocatalytic reduction in a stirred batch annular reactor, and methane was a main product. The photocatalytic decomposition of nitrous oxide was carried out in batch reactor with circulation, and only oxygen and nitrogen were detected as reaction products.

This provides a theoretical mechanism responsible for the enhanced activity and reduced activation energy of the photochemical reverse water gas shift reaction observed experimentally for In2O3?x(OH)y compared to the thermochemical reaction.

Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy directly manifests their distinct zinc vacancy concentrations, confirmed by positron annihilation spectrometry and electron spin resonance analysis. Density-functional calculations reveal that the presence of zinc vacancies ensures higher charge density and efficient carrier transport, verified by ultrafast photogenerated electron transfer time of ∼15 ps from the conduction band of ZnIn2S4 to the trap states. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy manifests the higher zinc vacancy concentration that allows for ∼1.7-fold increase in average recovery lifetime, confirmed by surface photovoltage spectroscopy and PL spectroscopy analysis, which ensures promoted carrier separation rates.

The oxygen vacancy (Vo) on metal oxides is expected to be a key factor affecting the efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction on metal-oxide-based catalysts. Yet, to date, the question of how an Vo influences photocatalytic CO2 reduction is still unanswered. Herein, we report that, on Vo-rich gallium oxide coated with Pt nanoparticles (Vo-rich Pt\/Ga2O3), CO2 is photocatalytically reduced to CO, with a highly enhanced CO evolution rate (21.0 μmol·h−1) compared to those on Vo-poor Pt\/Ga2O3 (3.9 μmol·h−1) and Pt\/TiO2(P25) (6.7 μmol·h−1).

We experimentally found that CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of pCN using electron microscopy analysis. The CND\/pCN-3 sample with a CND content of 3 wt.% showed the highest catalytic activity in the CO2 photoreduction process under visible and simulated solar light. This process results in the evolution of CH4 and CO. The total amounts of CH4 and CO generated by the CND\/pCN-3 photocatalyst after 10 h of visible-light activity were found to be 29.23 and 58.82 μmol·gcatalyst −1, respectively. These values were 3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than the amounts generated when using pCN alone. The corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated to be 0.076%. Furthermore, the CND\/pCN-3 sample demonstrated high stability and durability after four consecutive photoreaction cycles, with no significant decrease in the catalytic activity. The significant improvement in the photoactivity using CND\/pCN-3 was attributed to the synergistic interaction between pCN and CNDs. This synergy allows the effective migration of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via wellcontacted heterojunction interfaces, which retards the charge recombination. This was confirmed by photoelectrochemical measurements, and steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence analyses. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were consistent with our experimental\\r\\nresults, and showed that the work function of CNDs (5.56 eV) was larger than that of pCN (4.66 eV). This suggests that the efficient shuttling of electrons from the conduction band of pCN to CNDs hampers the recombination of electron–hole pairs. This significantly increased the probability of free charge carriers reducing CO2 to CH4 and CO. Overall, this study underlines the importance of understanding the charge carrier dynamics of the CND\/pCN hybrid nanocomposites, in order to enhance solar energy conversion.","W. J. Ong,L. K.

Integrating semiconductors with cocatalysts can improve the activities for photocatalytic CO2 reduction; however, most metal cocatalysts mainly produce CO and H2. Herein, we report a cocatalyst hydridation approach for significantly enhancing the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CH4. Hydriding Pd cocatalysts into PdH0.43 played a dual role in performance enhancement. As revealed by our isotopic labeling experiments, the PdH0.43 hydride cocatalysts reduced H2 evolution, which suppressed the H2 production and facilitated the conversion of the CO intermediate into the final product: CH4. Meanwhile, hydridation promoted the electron trapping on the cocatalysts, improving the charge separation. This approach increased the photocatalytic selectivity in CH4 production from 3.2% to 63.6% on Pd{100} and from 15.6% to 73.4% on Pd{111}.

The reactor design and sample pretreatment excludes product formation from intermediates. Apart from CO2, the only other reactant offered to the catalyst is water. The main products found on this prominent photocatalyst are methane and carbon monoxide. To distinguish between the three possible mechanisms reported in previous studies, likely intermediates of the reaction were added to the TiO2 photocatalyst and their reactivity was followed by gas chromatographic analysis. Based on the results, we can clearly rule out CO as intermediate of any photocatalytic reaction pathway on TiO2, because CO was not converted at all within a course of six hours. An improvement of carbonate formation on TiO2 brought about by surface-doping with sodium decreased product yields, so carbonates are unlikely intermediates as well. Methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid were exclusively oxidized back to CO2. We thus support a mechanism running over C2-intermediates, and we tested our hypothesis by reacting glyoxal, glyoxylic acid, acetic acid and acetaldehyde on TiO2. The reactions of acetaldehyde and acetic acid led to product distributions very similar to those obtained from CO2 under the standard reaction conditions, strongly supporting the C2 mechanism.

In addition, the material retained 98% of its initial photocatalytic CO2 conversion performance after five reaction cycles (20 h) because of the protective carbon layer and Z-schematic charge flow. We believe that this work provides a promising photocatalyst system that combines a 3-D NWA structure and a Z-scheme charge flow for efficient and stable CO2 conversion.","C. Kim,K.M. Cho,A.

The photogenerated excitations from the carbon nitride nanosheet can directionally migrate to B–H bonding, which effectively suppresses electron–hole pair recombination and thus greatly improves the photocatalytic ability. Compared to the g-C3N4 nanosheet, the BIF-20@g-C3N4 nanosheet composite displayed a much-enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity, which is equal to 9.7-fold enhancements in the CH4 evolution rate (15.524 μmol g–1 h–1) and 9.85-fold improvements in CO generation rate (53.869 μmol g–1 h–1).

A model photosynthetic system employing a composite of semiconductors with a Z-scheme can potentially mimic the combined power of photosystems 1 and 2 to transfer electrons. In this work, octahedral cuprous oxide covered with titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Cu2O\/TiO2) are synthesized by a solvothermal strategy that provides high morphological and crystallographic control. The formation of a p-n heterojunction and characterization of the Type II band alignment of the composite are performed by diffuse reflectance UV-visible (DRUV) spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Upon UV-visible irradiation (λ ≥ 305 nm) of the composite in the presence of water vapor as the hole scavenger, the photoreduction of CO2(g) proceeds selectively to generate CO(g). The production rate of CO by the composite, RCO = 2.11 μmol gcat −1 h−1, is 4-times larger than for pure Cu2O under identical conditions. Contrasting XPS analyses of Cu2O and Cu2O\/TiO2, during photocatalysts operation and the detection of photogenerated hydroxyl radicals (HO[rad]) in the heterostructure at variance with the results obtained for pure Cu2O are taken as evidences that TiO2 protects Cu2O from undergoing photocorrosion.

However, the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction into fuels such as methane (CH4) is substantially restricted by high CO2 activation barrier and inefficient proton supply. Here, Mo-doped WO3·0.33H2O nanorods have been synthesized and Mo doping in WO3·0.33H2O dramatically increased the CH4 production yield by 5.2 times from 1.02 to 5.3 μmol gcat⁻¹ h⁻¹ under water vapor without the assistant of any sacrificial agent or noble metal. The Mo doping proves capable of facilitating CO2 activation by improving the ability to store and localize photogenerated electrons and boosting the transfer of photoexcited electrons to adsorbed CO2. In addition, proton and electron insertion converts WO3·0.33H2O into tungsten bronze (HxWO3·0.33H2O) under light irradiation, guaranteeing required electrons and protons for CO2 reduction. The enhanced water oxidation of Mo-doped WO3·0.33H2O promotes proton supply and insertion process, improving the hydrogenation process of the carbon intermediate to generate CH4. The combined action of the enhanced CO2 activation and water oxidation with efficient proton and electron insertion improves the performance of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.

These heterojunctions displayed dramatically improved performance towards CO2 reduction to generate CO and CH4 under visible-light irradiation, compared to the base material (CN), P25 as reference, as well as binary BWO\/CN and RGO\/CN heterojunctions. Particularly, the BWO\/RGO\/CN heterojunctions with 1 wt. % RGO and 15 wt. % BWO achieved record performance in the yields of carbonaceous products (CO + CH4) compared to other synthesized catalysts, with a selectivity of 92% against H2. The remarkable photocatalytic performance was mainly attributed to the unique 2D\/2D\/2D architecture that creates large interfacial contact between the constituent materials for rapid charge transfer, to hinder the direct recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. Notably, RGO played two significant roles: as a supporter to capture the electrons from CN, and as a redox mediator to promote the Z-scheme charge transfer between CN and BWO. The result is a greater extent of charge separation in the present BWO\/RGO\/CN heterojunction system, as evidenced by the photoluminescence, photocurrent responses, and electron microscopy findings. More importantly, the heterojunctions displayed excellent stability during recycling tests with no obvious loss in the generation of CO and CH4 from photoreduction of CO2.

The effects of the precursor component ratio and synthesis temperature on the physicochemical properties of the composites are systematically investigated to maximize CO2 conversion efficiency. Under UV–vis–NIR light, the best performing sample had an average CO production rate of 60.77 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 54.7 times higher than that of pristine ZnO, and 11.5 times higher than that of commercial TiO2 (Degussa-P25).

The realization of NIR-driven CO2 photoreduction with enhanced photocatalytic activity benefits from 1) the hollow structure, which allows multiple internal reflections of light for enhanced light absorption; 2) the oxygen deficiency of ZnO1−x and the deposited carbon, which enable efficient charge carrier transfer and improved CO2 adsorption; and 3) the strong NIR absorption of ZnO1−x\/C, in which ZnO1−x is excited by absoring the up-converted photoluminescence emissions (410–560 nm) of the carbon dots.","L-Y.

However, the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance is greatly determined by the surface and interface structures of cocatalysts. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity in the CO2 reduction can be optimized through crystalline phase design of cocatalysts. In this work, Ru nanocrystals in face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases are in-situ grown on C3N4 nanosheets to form different C3N4-Ru hybrid structures, respectively. It was found that the hcp Ru achieved higher average CO and CH4 production rate but lower H2 production rate in comparison with fcc Ru. As revealed by the experimental characterizations combined with theory simulations, the phase-dependent photocatalytic performance is resulted from the different surface reaction behaviors on the fcc and hcp Ru cocatalysts. The adsorption energy of CO2 molecules on the dominated (101¯1) face of hcp Ru is higher than that on the dominated (111) face of fcc Ru. As a result, the stronger interaction between CO2 molecules and the surface of hcp Ru contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic activity and selectivity of C3N4-hcp Ru in reduction of CO2.

However, it is difficult to understand why the yield of CO—the other product of photocatalytic CO2 reduction—is decreased only in terms of photoinduced electron lifetime. In this work, the mechanism of Pt-promoted CH4 formation was probed again in a gas-solid system of photocatalytic CO2 reduction over highly-dispersed-Pt decorated In2O3 nanorods (Pt\/In2O3). It was found that the presence of Pt modulates the surface property of In2O3 due to electronic and steric effect, resulting in a loss of HCO3⁻, b-CO3²⁻ and m-CO3²⁻ species for the coadsorption of CO2 with H2O. However, this is not directly related with the high CH4 selectivity and low CO yield on the Pt\/In2O3 photocatalysts. Photocatalytic reductions of CO, HCOOH, CH2O, and CH3OH as well as photocatalytic CO2 reduction over photocatalysts with different H2 uptakes confirm that H adatoms derived from H2 or H2O dissociation on Pt play a key role in the formation of CH4. Low H2 dissociation barrier on Pt and weak H–Pt bond facilitate the bonding of C in CO2 with H, thus restraining CO production. In other words, the metallic Pt acts as atomic hydrogen reservoir that supplies sufficient and readily available protons for CH4 formation over Pt-decorated semiconductors. The present work offers a new window to explore non-noble metals or their alloys with stability in air and high dissociation ability to H2 or H2O as a replacement of Pt for CO2 photoreduction to CH4.","Y.

Because CO2 reduction is an uphill process with a large energy barrier, suitable catalysts are necessary to achieve this transformation. In addition, CO2 adsorption on a catalyst and proton transfer to CO2 are two important factors for the conversion reaction, and catalysts with high surface area and more active sites are required to improve the efficiency of CO2 reduction. Here, a visible light‐driven system for CO2‐to‐CO conversion is reported, which consists of a heterogeneous hybrid catalyst of Co and Co2P nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanolayers codoped with N and P (Co‐Co2P@NPC) and a homogeneous RuII‐based complex photosensitizer. The average generation rate of CO of the system was up to 35 000 μmol h−1 g−1 with selectivity of 79.1 % in 3 h. Linear CO production at an exceptionally high rate of 63 000 μmol h−1 g−1 was observed in the first hour of reaction. Inspired by this highly active catalyst, Co@NC and Co2P@NPC materials were also synthesized and their structure, morphology, and catalytic properties for CO2 photoreduction were explored.

The hollow structure is expected to trap incident photons to enhance the light absorbance. The sample annealed at 700 °C exhibited the optimized photocatalytic performance in the reduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor to methane.

The reduced performance of the sample done at 800 °C relative to the one annealed at 700 °C is attributed to the formation of additional impurities besides ZnGa2O4, possibly due to partial Zn(II) evaporation at higher temperature leading to segregation of potential Ga-based oxides.

A direct molecular-level influence of the functional group on the initial reaction rate for CO2 versus proton reduction reactions was established. Density functional theory computations elucidated for the first time the respective role of the [RhH] and [Cp*H] tautomers, recognizing rhodium hydride as the key player for both reactions. In particular, our calculations explain the observed tendency of electron-donating substituents to favor CO2 reduction by means of decreasing the hydricity of the Rh–H bond, resulting in a lower hydride transfer barrier toward formic acid production as compared to substituents with an electron-withdrawing nature that favor more strongly the reduction of protons to hydrogen.","T.K.

The present paper describes a significant improvement in photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sulfur\\r\\n(S) doped titania (S-TiO2) nanoparticles as a photocatalyst under UV-A and visible light\\r\\nirradiation. The sulfur doping was done by following a simple sonothermal method, and a\\r\\nseries of photocatalysts were synthesized with the varied amount of S doping. Various\\r\\ncharacterization techniques were employed for the photocatalysts such as XRD, surface\\r\\narea, UVeVisible, SEM, TEM, and XPS. The XPS reveals that S is predominantly present as\\r\\nS4þ in S-TiO2. The electronic structure for S-TiO2 anatase was calculated with the Vienna ab\\r\\ninitio simulation package (VASP) code in the framework of spin-polarized density functional theory. Additional states closer to the valence band are produced inside the band gap\\r\\nas a result of doping.

Constructing a direct Z-scheme heterojunction is an effective way to overcome the drawbacks of single-component or conventional heterogeneous photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Here, a novel type of direct Z-scheme g-C3N4\/SnS2 heterojunction was constructed by depositing SnS2 quantum dots onto the g-C3N4 surface in situ via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. l-Cysteine not only acted as the sulfur source, but also grafted ammine groups onto g-C3N4 in the hydrothermal process, which greatly enhanced the CO2 uptake of the composite. XPS analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation show that electron transfer occurred from g-C3N4 to SnS2, resulting in the formation of interfacial internal electric fields (IEF) between the two semiconductors at equilibrium. As a result, Z-scheme charge transfer took place under photoexcitation, with the electrons in SnS2 combining with the holes in g-C3N4, which improved the extraction and utilization of photoinduced electron in g-C3N4. The g-C3N4\/SnS2 hybrid shows superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction as compared with individual g-C3N4 and SnS2, which should be attributed to the IEF-induced direct Z-scheme as well as improved CO2 adsorption capacity. In situ FTIR spectra illustrate that HCOOH appeared as an intermediate during the CO2 conversion, which can only be generated by g-C3N4 according to the energy level of the photoinduced electrons, further confirming the Z-scheme configuration for the g-C3N4\/SnS2 system. \\r\\n\\r\\nA direct Z-scheme g-C 3 N 4 \/SnS 2 photocatalyst with superior visible-light CO 2 reduction performance","T.

The results showed that exposure to water and CO2 caused changes in its surface chemistry.

During this two-stage chemical process, the ZnGeON solid solution is tightly wrapped by ultrathin N-graphene sheets. Detailed investigations indicated that the N-graphene\/ZnGeON hybrids could not only catalyze the evolution of CH4 from the photocatalytic reaction of CO2 and H2O, but also catalyze the evolution of benzaldehyde from the photocatalytic reaction of benzyl alcohol and O2 under visible-light irradiation.

The hybrids showed highly efficient photocatalytic activities for the reduction of CO2to CH3OHunder visible-light irradiation.

Localized surface plasmon resonance induced hot electron injection and near-field enhancement, together with the enhanced charge separation caused by the Au NPs were found responsible for the promoted photocatalytic CO2 reduction on Au-modified TiO2. The Al2O3 interlayer inhibited electron transfer and dampened the near-field enhancement effect; however, it also served as passivation layer to suppress electron–hole recombination on the TiO2 surface. To further identify the significance of each of the mechanisms, photocatalysts with tailored thickness of Al2O3 interlayer and varied size of Au NPs were carefully synthesized, characterized, and tested for CO2 photoreduction with water. A finite difference time domain simulation was also conducted to correlate with the catalytic activity. The results show that the hot electron injection phenomenon was observable but very weak under visible light excitation. Charge separation and near-field enhancement were more dominant mechanisms under UV–vis irradiation and were closely related to the size of Au NPs. Charge separation was more significant for smaller Au NPs, whereas stronger near-field enhancement was found on larger Au NPs.

In addition to the formation of hydrogen from water, another focus is photocatalytic reduction in CO2. Because of the technical difficulties associated with hydrogen storage, products [5–8] from CO2, such as methane and methanol, can easily be used as current energy sources. It is well known that one of the most significant challenges in photoelectrochemical processes is highly efficient separation and transmission of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. To suppress a recombination and improve transmission of electron–hole pairs, researchers have designed many schemes. A novel photocatalyst Ag3PO4@MWCNTs@PANI and Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst Ag3PO4@MWCNTs@Cr:SrTiO3 were successfully prepared by a facile in situ precipitation method [9,10]. The MWCNTs penetrating in the bulk phase of Ag3PO4 could serve as conductors of photogenerated electrons and rapidly migrated electrons to the surface of the photocatalysts. Han et al. [11] synthesized uniform spherical CdS\/TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles with different TiO2 shell thicknesses, generating an energy gradient at the interface to spatially separate the electrons and holes. Zhan et al. [12] have prepared TiO2 nanorod films on FTO substrates, which exhibit a longer electron lifetime and more effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. A highly efficient Pt–TiO2 nanostructured film, with fast electron-transfer rate and efficient electron–hole separation by the Pt nanoparticles, is reported [13]. In this paper, we propose a material model of criss-crossed TiO2 nanoflakes combined with CdS (CNCC) and compared its photocatalytic activity with that of the usual TiO2 nanoparticles with CdS (NCC). The geometry structure of criss-crossed TiO2 nanoflakes is conductive to charge separation, therefore inhibiting recombination can significantly improve its CO2 photoreduction performance.","F.

Building heterojunctions can enhance photocatalysts performance, by facilitating charge transfer between two heterojunction phases. The material parameters that control this charge transfer remain unclear. Here, it is hypothesized that governing factors for CO2 photoreduction in gas phase are: i) a large porosity to accumulate CO2 molecules close to catalytic sites and ii) a high number of “points of contact” between the heterojunction components to enhance charge transfer. The former requirement can be met by using porous materials; the latter requirement by controlling the morphology of the heterojunction components. Hence, composites of titanium oxide or titanate and metal–organic framework (MOF), a highly porous material, are built. TiO2 or titanate nanofibers are synthesized and MOF particles are grown on the fibers. All composites produce CO under UV–vis light, using H2 as reducing agent. They are more active than their component materials, e.g., ≈9 times more active than titanate. The controlled composites morphology is confirmed and transient absorption spectroscopy highlights charge transfer between the composite components.

In this study, the polyaniline coated PbBi2Nb2O9 (PBNO\/CP) supported on glass fiber (GF) substrate is successfully synthesized as a photocatalyst for the CO2 conversion with water vapor (H2O) to selectively produce methane (CH4) under the visible light irradiation. The polyaniline coated on the PBNO surface acts as a photosensitizer, leading to the effective separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs under the visible light. The generated electrons and holes react with O2 and H2O molecules adsorbed on the PBNO surfaces to form the reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals (OH•) and superoxide anions (O2-•). Then they react with CO2 to produce CH4 and CO. Therefore, PBNO\/CP\/GF successfully converts CO2 to CH4 and CO with high efficiency under the visible light. The sufficient amounts of electrons and protons are generated by the PBNO\/CP\/GF photocatalyst that allowing the selective production of CH4 rather than CO. The synthesized photocatalyst with 10 % of polyaniline ratio (PBNO\/10%CP\/GF) shows the highest CO2 conversion and selectivity. The production rates of CH4 and CO are 72.76 and 54.36 μmol g-1 cat. h-1, respectively, and the selectivity of CO2 conversion is 89.33 %.","C-H. Lee,J. Sim,D-H.

The g−C3N4 catalysts before and after pretreatment were characterized by FE−SEM, XRD and photoilluminance.

Pretreated by suitable light intensity, air atmosphere and time, the CH4 yield on the g-C3N4 under concentrating light irradiation reached about 3.39 μmol·g-1·h-1, which is about 16 times of that g−C3N4 reacted at nature incident light without pretreatment.

To break through this limitation, we designed an ultrathin intermediate-band semiconductor, and hence first realized IR-driven CO2 overall splitting on a single material without using any sacrificial reductants. Taking the synthetic ultrathin cubic-WO3 layers as an example, theoretical calculations disclose that the created oxygen vacancies reaching a critical density results in an intermediate band, verified by synchrotron-radiation valence-band spectra, photoluminescence spectra, UV-vis-NIR spectra, and synchrotron-radiation IR reflectance spectra. As a result, the oxygen-deficient WO3 atomic layers display IR-driven CO2 overall splitting to CO and O2, while their catalytic activity proceeds without deactivation even after 3 days.

However, the extreme inertness of CO2 and the sluggish kinetics of photoexcited charge carrier transfer process greatly limit the conversion efficiency of CO2 photoreduction.

UV–visible (vis) absorption spectra and wavelength-dependent performances show that not only UV but also visible light play important roles in promoting CO2 reduction due to effective localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupling between Pt and Au NPs. Finite-difference time-domain simulations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy further reveal that effective coupling LSPR effect generates strong local electric fields and excites high concentration of hot electrons to activate the reactants and intermediate species, reduce the activation energies, and increase the reaction rate.

However, the catalytic activity and selectivity of GO are still very low. Herein, GO is first functionalized via noncovalent interactions by an aspartic acid modified anhydride having COOH groups to form A-GO. A-GO is more conductive and hydrophilic than GO and P-GO synthesized via functionalizing GO by a COOH-free anhydride. Then, we load CdS nanoparticles, which are responsible for absorbing light to produce charge carriers, on A-GO to fabricate a CdS\/A-GO photocatalyst without noble metals for the photoreduction of CO2 by H2O. CdS\/A-GO exhibits a higher photoreduction efficiency than that of CdS\/GO and CdS\/P-GO. The main carbon-based photoreduction product of CdS\/A-GO is CH3OH, whereas that of CdS\/GO and CdS\/P-GO is CO. The more conductive and hydrophilic A-GO triggers a more efficient electron transfer, CO2 adsorption, and production of hydrogen atoms from H2O dissociation, thus leading to the higher photoreduction efficiency and product change on CdS\/A-GO. Besides, the COOH groups of the aspartic acid modified anhydride supply their hydrogen atoms to promote the conversion from CO2 to CH3OH on CdS\/A-GO. Therefore, noncovalently functionalizing GO with different active species can efficiently improve the catalytic performance of GO.

Taking advantage of the surface junction between {001} and {101} facets, MnO x nanosheets and Pt nanoparticles are selectively deposited on each facet by a facile photodeposition method. This design accomplishes the formation of two heterojunctions: p-n junction between MnO x and TiO 2 {001} facet and metal-semiconductor junction between Pt and TiO 2 {101} facet.

Herein, we report a strategy for boosting the solar fuel generation rate of TiO2 by loading cocatalysts, specifically bimetallic Cu–Pt and CuO, via two-step photodeposition processes. Intriguingly, we can for the first time observe that the Cu2O nanoparticles present on the surface of TiO2 are partially redissolved into the solution because of the weak acidity induced by the Pt precursor. The sample of Cu–Pt\/TiO2–CuO shows a photocatalytic H2 generation rate of 173.7 μmol\/g·h under simulated sunlight conditions. For the photocatalytic CO2 reduction by water, the sample of Cu–Pt\/TiO2–CuO shows the release of H2, O2, CO, CH4, and CH3OH, whereby CO is the main reaction product. Typically, the yields of O2 and CO are 4.2 and 6.2 and 2.1 and 3.2 μmol\/h·g under LED-405 and LED-425, respectively; the CO2-to-CO conversion ratios with respect to separated carriers are 73.8 and 76.19%.","Jing Liu, Meng Liu, Xianglong Yang, Hao Chen, Shengzhong Frank Liu*, Junqing Yan*",8,junqingyan@snnu.edu.cn,CN,,12

However, the simultaneous manipulation of photocharges in the two locations is challenging. Herein, the synchronous promotion of bulk and surface separation of photoinduced charges for prominent CO2 photoreduction by coupling macroscopic spontaneous polarization and surface oxygen vacancies (OVs) of BiOIO3 single crystals is reported. The oriented growth of BiOIO3 single‐crystal nanostrips along the [001] direction, ensuing substantial well‐aligned IO3 polar units, renders a large enhancement for the macroscopic polarization electric field, which is capable of driving the rapid separation and migration of charges from bulk to surface. Meanwhile the introduction of surface OVs establishes a local electric field for charge migration to catalytic sites on the surface of BiOIO3 nanostrips. Highly polarized BiOIO3 nanostrips with ample OVs demonstrate outstanding CO2 reduction activity for CO production with a rate of 17.33 µmol g−1 h−1 (approximately ten times enhancement) without any sacrificial agents or cocatalysts, being one of the best CO2 reduction photocatalysts in the gas–solid system reported so far.

Experimentally, a class of ultrathin In2O3–ZnIn2Se4 (denoted as In2O3–ZISe) spontaneous Z‐scheme nanosheet photocatalysts for greatly enhancing photocatalytic H2 production is made. Furthermore, Mo atoms are incorporated in the Z‐scheme In2O3–ZISe nanosheet photocatalyst by forming the MoSe bond, confirmed by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in which the formed MoSe2 works as cocatalyst of the Z‐scheme photocatalyst. As a consequence, such a unique structure of In2O3–ZISe–Mo makes it exhibit 21.7 and 232.6 times higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activity than those of In2O3–ZnIn2Se4 and In2O3 nanosheets, respectively. Moreover, In2O3–ZISe–Mo is also very stable for photocatalytic H2 production by showing almost no activity decay for 16 h test.

The O-containing and C-containing section of the as-prepared catalysts (OCCNx) play the role of donor and acceptor, respectively. The donor-acceptor systems of OCCNx offer an extra electron transfer transition mode, which dramatically extends the optical absorption range, and narrows down the bandgap of g-CN from 2.74 to 2.03 eV.

CO2 photoreduction activity tests reveal that pure g-C3N4 (UCN) exhibits very weak photoactivity. However, when Ti3C2 was coupled with g-C3N4, the photocatalytic performance is soaringly enhanced. The optimal sample (10TC) shows the yields of 5.19 and 0.044 μmol h−1 g−1 for CO and CH4, respectively, and the total CO2 conversion is 8.1 times higher than that of UCN. The enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity is mainly attributed to the combined effects of (1) improved CO2 adsorption and activation, and (2) the construction of ultrathin 2D\/2D Ti3C2\/g-C3N4 heterojunction, where the intimate contact stimulates an efficient spatial separation of photo-excited charge carriers.","Chao Yang, Qiuyan Tan, Qin Li, Jie Zhou*, Jiajie Fan, Bing Li, Jie Sun, Kangle Lv",268,zhoujieuser@163.com,CN,,99

This novel structure has a significant improvement in the adsorption capacity of CO2 and reduction of the oxygen defect trap by introduction of Li species. Furthermore, owing to the built-in electric field directed from Li2TiO3 to TiO2, electrons are forced to move to the oxygen atom sites in Li2TiO3, which helps the plaque-like Li2TiO3\/TiO2 heterostructure photocatalyst achieve nearly 3 times performance improvement with about 100 % selectivity towards CO.

Mechanistic studies reveal that the deposited Cu2O enhances the CO2 chemisorption on the surface of catalysts and the formation of Z-scheme system between Cu2O and ZnO facilitates the photogenerated charge separation. The subsequent assembly of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) onto Cu2O is able to further promote the transfer of electrons due to the “electron sink” effect of Ag, which leads to the higher photocatalytic activity. As such, the synergy effect of strong CO2 chemisorption and multiple electrons transfer results in the boosted photocatalytic activity of Ag-Cu2O\/ZnO NRs for CO2 reduction. In addition, compared with the binary Cu2O\/ZnO NRs, the activity of Ag-Cu2O\/ZnO NRs can be well maintained after multiple-cycle reaction. The possible reason is that the deposited Ag can alleviate the self-photoreduction of Cu2O by transferring the excess electrons accumulated in the conduction band (CB) of Cu2O, thus preserving the stability of the Ag-Cu2O\/ZnO NRs photocatalyst.","Fan Zhang, Yue-Hua Li, Ming-Yu Qi, Zi-Rong Tang*, Yi-Jun Xu",268,zrtang@fzu.edu.cn,CN,,99

Nevertheless, the photoactivity has been pretty low to date, and deeper insights into improving CO2 conversion efficiency remain a challenge. Here, BiVO4 atomic layers have been synthesized as ideal platforms to investigate the correlation between the electronic structures and activities for CO2 photoreduction. Cobalt (Co) is then deliberately doped in BiVO4 atomic layers to adjust the electronic structures. XPS analysis, CO2 TPD and electrochemical experiments indicate that Co doping makes the electron densities around O anions increase, which could likely facilitate CO2 activation and electron transfer to CO2 molecules, while photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic oxygen evolution experiments demonstrate that Co doping could also promote water oxidation reactions. Further investigations by density functional theory calculation reveal that Co doping results in the generation of new defect levels above the Fermi level, inferring that a higher hole concentration is favorable for water oxidation, and the doped Co 3d orbits located at the top of valence bands might serve as active centers for water oxidation. As a result, Co-doped BiVO4 atomic layers achieve an efficient and stable CH4 production rate of 23.8 μmol g−1 h−1 under atmospheric CO2 concentration (400 ppm), which is about three times the activity of pristine BiVO4 atomic layers.

The as-prepared samples were systematically characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-vis DRS, XPS, PL, and Mott–Schottky analysis. It is realized that a further increase in the usage amount of TEOA promotes the CdS phase transformation from hexagonal wurtzite to cubic zinc-blende during the hydrothermal process, and detailed investigations indicate that the heteronanoparticles possess explicit heterointerfaces, strong light absorption, and tunable band gaps. Especially, when used as a photocatalyst towards the reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4 in the presence of H2O, the heterostructured CdS hybrids display not only a better photocatalytic CH4-\/CO-producing activity under visible-light irradiation than isolated CdS phase, but also unprecedented cycling stability without deactivation over 100 h. According to the physicochemical characterization, the remarkable improvement of photoactivity and stability over the CdS-based hybrid can be attributed to better electron–hole pair separation and migration owing to the junctions formed by the coexistence of wurtzite and zinc-blende in the CdS nanohybrids. Moreover, the role of the junctions endowed by wurtzite\/zinc-blende CdS in the process of the CO2 photoreduction is evaluated using transient photocurrents and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis, illustrating its fast-interfacial charge transfer.

To improve the photocatalytic performance, innovative materials modifications were employed by decorating TiO2 with atomic layer deposited (ALD) MgO overcoating and photodeposited silver (Ag) nanoparticles at different orders: MgO deposition followed by Ag (i.e. Ag\/MgO\/ TiO2), or Ag deposition followed by MgO (i.e. MgO\/Ag\/TiO2). The addition of Ag promoted transfer of photoinduced electrons, while the coating of an ultrathin MgO layer inhibited surface charge recombination and enhanced CO2 adsorption. The combination of MgO and Ag resulted in synergistic promotion on CO2 photoreduction greater than the sum of individual promotional effects. The Ag\/MgO\/TiO2 catalyst with 7 ALD layers of MgO and 5% Ag was 14 times more active than the pristine TiO2 in terms of CO and CH4 production. In\\r\\naddition, the sequence of MgO\/Ag decoration influenced the catalytic activity. The Ag\/MgO\/TiO2 catalysts were in general more active than the MgO\/Ag\/TiO2 counterparts, likely due to the different electron mobility and Ag nanoparticle distribution on the surface. This work for the first time reports the novel materials structure of ALD coated MgO and photodeposited Ag nanoparticles on TiO2, and it reveals the importance of optimizing materials morphology and structure to promote the catalytic activity.","Xuhui Feng, Fuping Pan, Brandon Z.

Since the defects in a catalyst play an important role in CO2 reduction, herein, the porous ZnO nanoplates with vacancy defects are synthesized by annealing ZnS(en)0.5 precursor in air at different temperature. The defect amount in ZnO changes with the annealing temperature, resulting in different photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. The related mechanism has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. Raman spectra and chemical composition of the obtained catalysts are used to determine the defects. Transient techniques are used to investigate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. CO2 adsorption capacity for different catalysts is also measured. First-principles calculation is used to study the adsorption and activation of CO2 on the ZnO surface.

The close interaction of Cr2O3 and TiO2 forms a p–n junction that decreases the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, leading to enhanced production of CH4 by photocatalytic reduction of CO2.","Dr. Jeannie Z.

The key challenge lies in the exploitation of efficient bifunctional photocatalysts, capable of triggering both aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction reactions. In this work, a bifunctional ternary g-C3N4\/Bi\/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst is successfully constructed, which not only demonstrates superior aerobic photocatalytic oxidation performance in degrading an organic pollutant (using the dye, Rhodamine B as a model), but also exhibits impressive photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, a direct conversion of Rhodamine B to solar fuels in a one-pot anaerobic reactor can be achieved with the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4\/Bi\/BiVO4 hybrid photocatalyst. The excellent bifunctional photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4\/Bi\/BiVO4 photocatalyst is associated with the formation of efficient S-scheme hybrid junctions, which contribute to promoting the appropriate charge dynamics, and sustaining favorable charge potentials. The formation of the S-scheme heterojunction is supported by scavenger studies and density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the in-situ formed plasmonic metallic Bi nanoparticles in the S-scheme hybrid g-C3N4\/Bi\/BiVO4 photocatalyst enhances vectorial interfacial electron transfer.

However, insufficient separation of charge carriers and weak CO2 adsorption hamper the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Herein, we tackle these challenges by introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the two-dimensional Bi4Ti3O12 ultrathin nanosheets via a combined hydrothermal and post-reduction process. Selective photodeposition experiment of Pt over Bi4Ti3O12 discloses that the ultrathin structure shortens the migration distance of photo-induced electrons from bulk to the surface, benefiting the fast participation in the CO2 reduction reaction. The introduction of OVs on ultrathin Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets leads to enormous amelioration on surface state and electronic structure, thereby resulting in enhanced CO2 adsorption, photoabsorption and charge separation efficiency. The photocatalytic experiments uncover that ultrathin Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with OVs reveal a largely enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity for producing CO with a rate of 11.7 μmol g−1 h−1 in the gas–solid system, ~3.2 times higher than that of bulk Bi4Ti3O12.

However, factors controlling product selectivity remain poorly understood. Herein, we compared the performance of a homologous series of Zn-based layered double hydroxide (ZnM-LDH) photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. By varying the trivalent or tetravalent metal cations in the ZnM-LDH photocatalysts (M = Ti4+, Fe3+, Co3+, Ga3+, Al3+), the product selectivity of the reaction could be precisely controlled. ZnTi-LDH afforded CH4 as the main reduction product; ZnFe-LDH and ZnCo-LDH yielded H2 exclusively from water splitting; whilst ZnGa-LDH and ZnAl-LDH generated CO. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared measurements, valence band XPS and density function theory calculations were applied to rationalize the CO2 reduction selectivities of the different ZnM-LDH photocatalysts. The analyses revealed that the d-band center (εd) position of the M3+ or M4+ cations controlled the adsorption strength of CO2 and thus the selectivity to carbon-containing products or H2. Cations with d-band centers relatively close to the Fermi level (Ti4+, Ga3+ and Al3+) adsorbed CO2 strongly yielding CH4 or CO, whereas metal cations with d-band centers further from the Fermi level (Fe3+ and Co3+) adsorbed CO2 poorly, thereby yielding H2 only (from water splitting). Our findings clarify the role of trivalent and tetravalent metal cations in LDH photocatalysts for the selective CO2 reduction, paving new ways for the development of improved LDH photocatalyst with high selectivities to specific products.","Xuyang Xiong, Yufei Zhao, Run Shi, Wenjin Yin, Yunxuan Zhao, Tierui Zhang*,Geoffrey I.N.Waterhouse",0,tierui@mail.ipc.ac.cn,"CN,NZ",,259

Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is constrained by the inertness of the surface and particle aggregation during photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report the preparation of g-C3N4 with honeycomb-like morphology (HC-C3N4) via thermal condensation of prepared SiO2 templates and dicyandiamide. The etching out of the SiO2 templates by NH4HF2 created hollow or macropores in the C3N4 matrix resulting in its structural changes. Similar, to the bulk C3N4, the HC-C3N4 exhibited higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction in hydrocarbons. This improved photocatalytic achievement is associated with higher specific surface area, excellent visible light absorption capability, higher electron donor density, easy mass diffusion of materials for surface reaction, and effective segregation of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, the HC-C3N4 honeycomb structure was deposited with Ni(OH)2 clusters which showed remarkable CO2 reduction activity of 1.48 μmolh−1 g−1 of CH4 and 0.73 μmolh−1 g−1 of CH3OH generation which is 3.5 and 4.3 times higher CO2 reduction activity compared with bulk C3N4 clustered with Ni(OH)2 particles.

The characterization revealed that cocatalysts loaded on the surface of HST can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes due to the formation of Schottky barrier or p-n junction, thus enhancing photocatalytic activity. Of note, Ag, Pd, Au, Cu2O loading exhibited obviously different performance on promoting photocatalytic activity of HST toward CO evolution and H2 evolution because of the different overpotentials of CO evolution and H2 evolution on loaded photocatalysts. Cocatalysts with low overpotentials of CO or H2 evolution act as active sites for CO or H2 evolution, thus controlling the selectivity toward CO or H2. The Au\/HST exhibited high activity for only H2 evolution (17.5 μmol g−1 h−1) due to relative low overpotential for H2 evolution (0.67 V) while the Cu2O\/HST exhibited high activity only for CO evolution (0.23 μmol g−1 h−1) due to relative low overpotential for CO evolution (0.40 V). The Pd\/HST sample exhibits high photocatalytic activity for both CO and H2 evolution rates due to the low overpotential for CO and H2 evolution, reaching 4.0 and 4.7 times of bare HST, respectively.

With further increasing the Mo concentrations, the CH4 selectivity begins to decrease.

Moreover, photocatalytic CO, formaldehyde, and methanol reductions with H2O and ·CH3 trapping show that the enhanced CH4 selectivity is not directly related with the interaction of CO2 with catalyst surfaces.

Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry confirmed the introduction of amino groups, and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra provided a support for inferring the position of the amino group.","Fang Li, Haiping Zhou, Jiajie Fan, Quanjun Xiang*",570,xiangqj@uestc.edu.cn,CN,,514

Herein, we prepared a series of highly efficient heterostructure based on highly dispersed palladium supported on ultrathin CoAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH). In conjunction with a Ru-complex sensitizer, the molar ratios of CO\/H2 can be tuned from 1:0.74 to 1:3 under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm).

However, the low separation efficiency of charge carriers and deficient reactive sites have severely hampered the efficiency of the photocatalytic CO2 reforming process. Therefore, cocatalysts are usually loaded onto the surface of semiconductor photocatalysts to reduce the recombination of charge carriers and accelerate the rates of surface reactions. Herein, molybdenum (Mo) nanospheres are proposed as a novel non-precious cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic CO2 reforming of g-C3N4 significantly. The Mo nanospheres boost the adsorption of CO2 and activate the surface CO2 via a photothermal effect. The time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra reveals that the lifetime of photo-induced charge carriers is prolonged by the Mo nanospheres, which guarantees the migration of charge carriers from g-C3N4 to Mo nanospheres. Unexpectedly, Mo loaded g-C3N4 can effectively utilize a wide spectral range from UV to near-infrared region (NIR, up to 800 nm).

These active sites favored the formation of monodentate bonds between CO2 and CuO, which promoted its photoconversion to solar fuels such as CH3OH. Additionally, CuO\/Cu(OH)2 mixtures with the high surface area were identified at higher concentrations of Na3C6H5O7. However, these mixtures did not show high efficiencies for both processes. A mechanism of combined CO2 adsorption and its photocatalytic conversion to methanol under visible light was proposed. The stability and recyclability of CuO as CO2 adsorbent and as a photocatalyst was demonstrated after three consecutive cycles without compromise its efficiency in the combined process.","Manuel Alejandro Ávila López*, E.Luévano Hipólito, Leticia M.Torres-Martínez",382,eluevano@conacyt.mx,MX,,598

Also, this process would help to reduce the CO2 concentration to mitigate the global temperature and could partly fulfill energy demands.

Thus, it is necessary to support the photocatalyst in materials that provided strong basic active sites to adsorb CO2 spontaneously.

Cu2O supported on activated-dolomite (Cu\/DA) was evaluated in the photocatalytic CO2 conversion to solar fuels (CH3OH and HCOH) under LED-visible light, and its capacity to adsorb CO2 was evidenced by gas chromatography. The dolomite-activated sample (DA) exhibited high surface area (125 m2 g−1), low spherical and homogeneous particle size (200 nm), and small pore diameter (<2 nm), which contribute to a high amount of CO2 adsorbed (180 mgCO2 g−1).

After supported Cu2O in DA, CH3OH generation (38 μmol g−1 h−1) was favored up to 3.4 times.

Developing ferroelectrics directly as photoactive semiconducting catalysts may be promising in view of the strong ferroelectric polarization that induces the anisotropic charge separation. Here, we report a ferroelectric layered perovskite SrBi4Ti4O15 as a robust photocatalyst for efficient CO2 reduction. In the absence of co-catalysts and sacrificial agents, the annealed SrBi4Ti4O15 nanosheets with the strongest ferroelectricity cast a prominent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity for CH4 evolution with a rate of 19.8 μmol h−1 g−1 in the gas-solid reaction system, achieving an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 1.33% at 365 nm, outperforming most of the reported photocatalysts. The ferroelectric hysteresis loop, piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and ns-level time-resolved fluorescence spectra uncover that the outstanding CO2 photoreduction activity of SrBi4Ti4O15 mainly stems from the strong ferroelectric spontaneous polarization along [100] direction, which allows efficient bulk charge separation along opposite direction. DFT calculations also disclose that both electrons and holes show the smallest effective masses along a axis, verifying the high mobility of charge carriers facilitated by ferroelectric polarization. This study suggests that the traditionally semiconducting ferroelectric materials that have long been studied as ferro\/piezoelectric ceramics now may be powerfully applied in the photocatalytic field to deal with the growing energy crisis.","Shuchen Tu, Yihe Zhang*, Ali H.Reshak, Sushil Auluck, Liqun Ye, Xiaopeng Han, Tianyi Ma, Hongwei Huang",56,zyh@cugb.edu.cn,CN,,779

Herein, we developed a selective and stable photocatalyst for CO2 photocatalytic reduction into C2H6 through a multi-electron transfer pathway without the external sacrificial regents. The core component of this composite catalyst was extracted from a silkworm excrement and modified to make chlorophyll Cu (Chl-Cu), which contained a porphyrin structure as an antenna for light absorption and a Cu cation as an active centre. We found that C2 hydrocarbons such as C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 tended to generate on chlorophyll-a\/graphene. After substituting Mg2+ with Cu2+ cations in the centre of the porphyrin and modifying with graphene, only C2H6 was detected in the 18 hours reaction. This photocatalyst presented an outstanding activity and selectivity for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) with a C2H6 yield rate at 68.23 μmol m−2 h−1 under visible light irradiation and an apparent quantum efficiency of 1.26% at 420 nm.

To promote CO2 reduction, Pt\/TiO2 has been deemed as a classic photocatalyst. In this study, we restudy Pt\/TiO2 for the thermally assisted photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and reveal a different story between photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis. For example, when using disordered Pt\/TiO2−x, the CO2 conversion via photocatalysis at 298 K is not impressive. However, when the system temperature is increased to 393 K, the CO2 conversion rate is significantly enhanced by a factor of 155 as compared to that obtainable from pristine TiO2; further, surprisingly high selectivity of CH4 (87.5%) could be achieved. Thermally coupled photocatalysis yields the enhanced evolution of H2 side products over Pt (4.06 nm)\/TiO2 and promoted H2 splitting over Pt (2.33 nm)\/TiO2, which is seldom observed in conventional Pt\/TiO2 photocatalysis. The synergy of improved charge separation at the Pt\/TiO2−x interface induced by surface disordering and accelerated H2 consumption near smaller Pt nanoparticles by thermal assistance are believed to be critically important for the simultaneous enhancement of CO2 conversion rates and CH4 product selectivity. This study inspires revisiting not only Pt\/TiO2 but also reactivating other semiconductor–oxide-based photocatalysts for use in thermally assisted photocatalysis.","Fei Yu, Changhua Wang*, He Ma, Miao Song, Dongsheng Li, Yingying Li, Songmei Li, Xintong Zhang, Yichun Liua",12,wangch100@nenu.edu.cn,CN,,788

In the present paper, a hierarchical Ni-NiS\/C\/ZnO photocatalyst was prepared via the in situ photodeposition of compact Ni-NiS nanosheets onto C\/ZnO electrospun nanofibers. The existence of metallic Ni and NiS was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL spectra revealed that the cocatalyst Ni-NiS enhanced the charge separation efficiency of the C\/ZnO nanofibers. The as-prepared Ni-NiS\/C\/ZnO showed enhanced CO2 reduction activity, with CO and CH4 production rates 10 and 15 times greater than those of pristine C\/ZnO under 350 W visible light illumination. The intermediates of CH3O−, HCHO, and HCOO− were detected by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, confirming that CO2 reduction is a complex reaction with multiple steps. The 13C isotopic tracer method proved that CH4 and CO were obtained from the reduction of CO2 rather than from other carbon species in the environment. The amorphous carbon in C\/ZnO could promote optical absorption, improve conductivity and reduce the interfacial charge transport resistance. Ni-NiS improved the electron–hole-pair separation of the C\/ZnO nanofibers.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are prospective photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, but severe charge recombination and limited visible light response largely restrain their applications. As carbon dots (CDs) can act as both electron receptors and photosensitizers, here we propose to develop CD-hybridized MOF photocatalysts for improving their activity for CO2 reduction. In particular, because of the small size of CDs, we have managed to encapsulate CDs inside MOF particles and found that these CD@MOFs exhibit hugely improved photocatalytic activity compared with CD-decorated MOFs or pristine MOFs. Our investigations suggest that placing small CD cocatalysts near the internal metal–oxo clusters of MOFs can help efficient charge transfer and separation in the hybrid photocatalysts, due to the formation of many small heterojunctions among MOFs. The developed CD-hybridized MOF catalysts are characterized in detail and their working mechanism is explored.

Here, we constructed a CuGaS2\/CdS hybrid photocatalyst dominated by a Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. The transfer of photo-generated electrons from excited nanocrystalline CdS to CuGaS2 across the coherent interface reduces Cu2+ formation and favors Cu+ regeneration. This process suppresses the deactivation of CuGaS2 and maintains high performance. Both the activity and stability of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce CO over the CuGaS2\/CdS hybrid were remarkably improved, which was approximately 4-fold higher than CuGaS2 and 3-fold higher than CdS in converting CO2 into CO.

For CO2 photocatalytic reduction, the superior behavior originated from the reduced band gap and the effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers.

With desirable band offsets and strong joint redox potential, the dual photocatalyst is shown to form a semicoherent heterointerface. Ultrafast transient infrared absorption studies employing selective excitation reveal synergetic photocarrier dynamics and demonstrate Z-scheme charge transfer mechanisms. Under simulated solar irradiation, a large driving force photoredox reaction (∼2.57 eV) of CO2 reduction coupled with benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde is achieved on the Z-scheme FAPbBr3\/Bi2WO6 photocatalyst, harnessing the full synergetic potential of the combined system.","Haowei Huang, Jiwu Zhao, Yijie Du, Chen Zhou, Menglong Zhang, Zhuan Wang, YuXiang Weng, Jinlin Long, Johan Hofkens, Julian A.

Here, we developed an approach, for the first time, to construct a curly-like carbon nitride nanosheets with the formation of in-plane surface dyadic heterostructure for steering the charge transfer and optimizing the electronic band structure. This PCN material shows superior photoreforming H2 evolved activity of 122.77 μmolh−1 (i.e. 4092 μmolh−1g−1) from the aqueous lignocellulose solution (using Pt as cocatalyst), 15.6 folds of pristine PCN under visible light irradiation, together with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 7.87% (λ = 420 nm). It enables the visible-light-driven conversion of several kinds of lignocellulose including the monosaccharides, disaccharides, hemicellulose, and cellulose. Additionally, when used as a photocatalyst for water splitting, it achieves a remarkable H2 production rate of 22043 μmolh−1g−1 (∼56.0 folds’ increases than pristine PCN) with a superior high AQE of 41.2%, as well as a high CO reduction rate of 56.3 μmolh−1 from the photocatalytic CO2 conversion, 24.5 times than pristine PCN.","Qiong Liu,Fuxian Wang,Yu Jiang,Wei Chen,Ren Zou,Jiliang Ma,Linxin Zhong,Xinwen Peng",170,fexwpeng@scut.edu.cn,"CN,CN,CN,CN,CN,CN,CN,CN",,171

PBG can redistribute density of optical state. When the PBG overlaps with the emission of an emitter embedded in PC, the excited electrons will be prohibited from transferring to the ground state. Introducing PC with suitable PBG into photocatalyst will partially reduce the electron–hole combination and improve photocatalytic efciency. Meanwhile, appropriate specifc surface area of 3-D quasi-ordered structure can increase the contact area of catalysts and CO2 to provide more catalytic sites, which plays an important role in the improvement of photocatalytic activity. Herein, SiO2@Ni\/TiO2 PCs with designed PBG were fabricated and applied as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O as photosensitizer. The designed SiO2@Ni\/TiO2 PCs has a suitable specifc surface area and certain surface roughness, which can efectively adsorb CO2 for photocatalytic reduction. Meanwhile, the PBG of SiO2@Ni\/TiO2 PCs matches well with the electron–hole combination energy of the photosensitizer, the electron–hole combination process from the excited state falling back to the ground state can be prevented partially. Suppressing the falling of excited electrons will make electrons transfer to the catalyst, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance.","Suli Wu, Weixia Yang, Zhipeng Meng, Lu Li, Shufen Zhang",0,NoMail@NoMail.org,CN,,176

The deposition of both metals on the TiO2 surface was performed using a deposition method in independent steps. Characterization studies reveal a parallel distribution of both metals, with a preferential surface exposure of silver nanoparticles (NPs). The close contact between metal NPs and TiO2 allows an efficient charge transfer between both phases upon excitation, which results in a distinct reaction mechanism under ultraviolet (UV) and visible illumination. Under UV light, bimetallic catalysts are able to shift the reaction selectivity toward methane, compared to the solely syngas (CO + H2) production over bare TiO2.

Among the prepared catalysts, u-0.05PEI presents the best photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, with CO and CH4 yields of 32.86 and 1.68 μmol g−1 in 4 h, which is about 3.2 and 2.5 times higher than that of g-CN, respectively. Characterization results show that both C and N defects are formed in the newly prepared catalysts. The C defects on the surface of u-xPEI result in the formation of more amino groups which are beneficial for CO2 adsorption. Meanwhile, the N defects inside the samples lead to the generation of midgap states between the valance band and conduction band of u-xPEI. The midgap states greatly enlarge the light absorption extent, and enable the use of light with energy lower than the intrinsic absorption of g-CN in the photoreduction of CO2. As confirmed by DRS, EPR, PL analysis, the excellent catalytic activity of u-0.05PEI is mainly attributed to the remarkably improved light utilization efficiency and fast charge transfer.

The CCPC process implies the use of CO2, solar light, and materials to produce solar fuels of low carbon content. The materials must fulfill with the double function of capture and photocatalytic convert of the CO2 into solar fuels. For this purpose, copper oxide (CuO) is an excellent candidate to act as both: adsorbent and photocatalyst. Scaling-up the CCPC process requires the immobilization of CuO on commercially available substrates such as glass fibers, which offers a homogeneous surface exposure, efficient absorption of solar energy, and an easy application in reactors. In this work, the fabrication of CuO coatings on glass fibers by a simple microwave-hydrothermal method to produce solar fuels (CH3OH and HCOH) in CCPC process is proposed. Three glass fibers with different chemical compositions and slit (open area) were selected as supports. The best efficiency for CO2 capture (3080 mgCO2 g−1) was obtained with the CuO coating deposited in a substrate rich in Na2O and CaO. Once the CO2 was adsorbed, the coatings were exposed to visible LED light to carry out its conversion to solar fuels (CH3OH and HCOH). According to the results, both high CuO content and high slits in the fibers promoted an increase in the CO2 conversion to HCOH (2.7 nmol cm−2 h−1) and CH3OH (37.6 nmol h−1 cm−2). The presence of Na2O in the substrates played an essential role as a hole scavenger in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, preventing the re-oxidation of the products. The use of glass fibers as support of CuO promoted efficiencies up to 11 times higher than other materials used in CCPC process.","Manuel Alejandro Ávila,Edith Luévano-Hipólito,Leticia M.

Under full solar spectrum irradiation, CO as the main product with 97.2% selectivity is observed on bare CdS, whereas the intentional introduction of optimized amount of Ru metal enables CO2 reduction to CH4 with 97.6% selectivity. A series of experiments and characterizations reveal that the single‐atom dispersed Ru serves as adsorption and active sites of CO2 molecules as well as electron traps, resulting in great improvement in CO2 uptake capability of the catalyst and the effective suppression in the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the thermal effect synchronously induced by light has a positive influence on photocatalysis, which can prominently enhance the catalytic activity without altering the product selectivity.","Songcai Cai,Hongpeng Jia,Jing Chen,Juanjuan Li,Meng Zhang",0,hpjia@iue.ac.cn,"CN,CN,CN,CN,CN",,645

This issue could be addressed in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) through optimization of the charge-transfer kinetics via rational design of structures at atomic level. Herein, a pyrazolyl porphyrinic Ni-MOF (PCN-601), integrating light harvesters, active catalytic sites, and high surface areas, has been demonstrated as a superior and durable photocatalyst for visible-light-driven overall CO2 reduction with H2O vapor at room temperature. Kinetic studies reveal that the robust coordination spheres of pyrazolyl groups and Ni-oxo clusters endow PCN-601 with proper energy band alignment and ultrafast ligand-to-node electron transfer. Consequently, the CO2-to-CH4 production rate of PCN-601 far exceeds those of the analogous MOFs based on carboxylate porphyrin and the classic Pt\/CdS photocatalyst by more than 3- and 20-fold, respectively. The reaction avoids the use of hole scavengers and proceeds in a gaseous phase which can take full advantage of the high gas uptake of MOFs. This work demonstrates that the rational design of coordination spheres in MOF structures not only reconciles the contradiction between reactivity and stability but also greatly promotes the interfacial charge transfer to achieve optimized kinetics, providing guidance for the design of highly efficient MOF photocatalysts.","Zhi-Bin Fang, Ting-Ting Liu, Junxue Liu, Shengye Jin, Xin-Ping Wu, Xue-Qing Gong, Kecheng Wang, Qi Yin, Tian-Fu Liu, Rong Cao*, Hong-Cai Zhou",142,rcao@fjirsm.ac.cn,CN,,657

Herein, a simple yet robust double-solvent-induced self-assembly strategy is, for the first time, developed to yield supramolecular precursors using a single monomer for crafting one-dimensional (1D), highly porous g-C3N4 microtubes that possess remarkable photocatalytic CO2 conversion performance. Intriguingly, the introduction of water and isopropanol triggers the self-assembly of dicyandiamide under hydrothermal conditions to form a melamine-cyanaurate-like complex (MCC) composed of 1D hexagon-shaped, micron-sized crystals with outstanding thermal stability. Subsequent thermal pyrolysis converts these pillar-like crystals into 1D mesoporous g-C3N4 microtubes (denoted MCNM) comprising well-packed nano-leaf-like frameworks (i.e., hierarchical structure). Such unique microtubes are oxygen-doped g-C3N4 and mechanically stable, exhibiting improved visible-light harvesting ability, enhanced charge transfer, increased active sites, and preferred adsorption and activation for CO2, as revealed by a suite of characterization techniques. Consequently, in sharp contrast to bulk g-C3N4, the MCNM manifests a markedly improved photocatalytic activity with a CO evolution rate of 45.16 μmolh−1, reflecting an 11.0-fold enhancement and an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.55% at 420 nm.

The artificial photosynthesis technology involving the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to solar fuels is one of the most promising strategies to reduce CO2 and utilize it to produce alternative chemical energy such as methane and methanol. Unfortunately, photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance based on graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4) is usually limited by poor charge separation ability and limited CO2 adsorption ability. Herein, novel ternary g‐C3N4\/ZnNCN@ZIF‐8 hybrid photocatalysts with robust interfacial interactions via ZnN bonding are constructed by sequential in situ interfacial reactions, to overcome the aforementioned two shortcomings and to enhance photocatalytic CO2 conversion efficiency. Because of the synergetic effects of g‐C3N4\/ZnNCN interfacial Z‐scheme heterostructuring and surface‐passivated ZIF‐8 grafting in improving light harvesting ability, enhancing CO2 capture capacity, and promoting interfacial charge transfer efficiency, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of novel ternary g‐C3N4\/ZnNCN@ZIF‐8 hybrid photocatalyst is significantly improved by 104.6%, relative to that of g‐C3N4.

The surface chemical states were completely examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy before and after CO2 reduction.

Facilitated from light irradiation, H-incorporated oxygen vacancies form on defective TiO2 nanotube matrix to extend light adsorption range, meanwhile Bi0 atom is reduced from BiOCl lamina to restructure atomic heterojunction BiOCl-Bi0-TiO2.

Herein, two types of composite photocatalysts (TiO2\/ZIF-8) based on ZIF-8 and TiO2 have been designed and synthesized with the help of the grinding method and the solid-synthesis method. Both composite photocatalysts are employed for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. In composite photocatalysts prepared by the grinding method, ZIF-8 particles are distributed on the surface of TiO2, and provide extra available spaces for storing CO2, which is beneficial for improving their photoreduction performances. As a result, an enhanced CO formation rate of 21.74 μmol g−1 h−1 with a high selectivity of 99% is obtained for this family of composite photocatalysts via the solid–gas mode without photosensitizers and sacrificial agents. For comparison, the other family of composite photocatalysts synthesized via the solid-synthesis method possesses structures similar to ZIF-8, where TiO2 is encapsulated inside the framework of ZIF-8. This structural feature obstructs the contact between the active sites of TiO2 and CO2, and leads to lower activities. The best CO formation rate of this family is only 10.67 μmol g−1 h−1 with 90% selectivity. Both the structural features of the two families of photocatalysts are described to explain their differences in photoreduction performances. The experimental finding reveals that different synthetic approaches indeed result in diversified structures and varied photocatalytic performances.
